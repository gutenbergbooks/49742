<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>There have been many histories of the Battle
of Lexington and of the Battle of Concord, some
of them excellent to the extent of that part of
the contest to which they were devoted. From
time to time gifted orators have gone to the one
town or to the other, and eloquently portrayed
the heroic deeds of men within that town on the
opening day of the American Revolution. No
fault should be found with any of those, designed
as a healthy stimulus to local pride, and to
foster sentiments of national patriotism.</p>

<p>But the student in American local history
needs a more extensive view of the operations of
that day. He needs to be better informed as to
the various scenes of carnage that were waged
along all of those nearly twenty miles of highway.
Men were slain in Lexington, and in
Concord; but there were many others slain in
Lincoln, in Arlington, in Cambridge, and in
Somerville. Nor should we forget the youngest
martyr of the day, but fourteen years of age,
who fell in Charlestown.</p>

<p>For the purpose, then, of presenting to such
as may be interested, I have assembled here the
most comprehensive account that has ever been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
offered, and one that aims to be a history of the
entire day. I have endeavored to make it not
only complete and interesting, but just and
reliable, recognizing fully the rights of my own
ancestors to rebel, and also recognizing the
rights of the mother country to prevent such
rebellion&mdash;even by an appeal to arms. Since
those days we have grown to be a mother
country ourselves, and have had reason, on more
than one occasion, to exercise that accepted
right of parental control.</p>

<p>This narrative is based upon official reports,
sworn statements, diaries, letters, and narratives
of participants and witnesses; upon accounts of
local historians and national orators; and, in a
few cases, upon tradition, if such seemed
authentic and trustworthy.</p>

<p>But I am sorry to say, that in more than one
instance, I have found even the sworn statements
at variance with each other. I am satisfied
that the authors did not intend to mislead
in any way, but simply tried to tell to others
what appeared to them. Their mental excitement
naturally added a little of that vivid
coloring noticeable in most war narratives of a
personal nature. My work has been to harmonize
and simplify these, and to extract simply
the truth.</p>

<p>In 1775 the greater part of the present town of
Arlington was a part of Cambridge, and known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
as the Menotomy Precinct. Later it was incorporated
as a separate town and called West Cambridge.
Later still its name was changed to
Arlington. Somerville, in that year, was a part of
Charlestown. What remained of Charlestown
eventually became a part of Boston, though
still retaining its ancient name. In writing of the
events that happened within the boundaries of
each, I shall speak of them as of Arlington, of
Somerville, and of Charlestown.</p>

<p>I am glad to add that the bitterness and
hatred, so much in evidence on that long-ago
battle day, no longer exist between the children
of the great British Nation.</p>

<p>The Amos Doolittle Pictures of Lexington and Concord, copperplate
engravings, size about 12 x 18 inches, and hand-colored, were
originally published by James Lockwood in New Haven, December
13, 1775. The drawings were made by Mr. Earl, a portrait painter,
and the engravings therefrom were by Amos Doolittle. Both were
members of the Governor's Guard, and came on to Cambridge as
volunteers under Benedict Arnold immediately after the battle of
April 19th, and soon after commenced these early specimens of
American art. The student of today prizes them, not for their
artistic excellence, but for their faithfulness in depicting the scenery,
buildings, and troops engaged.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Book Buyer</cite> for January, 1898, is an illustrated article
on Early American Copperplate Engraving, by William Loring
Andrews. I am indebted to him, and to the publishers, Charles
Scribners' Sons, for permission to copy the Doolittle set for this work.</p>

<p class="pfs135">THE BATTLE OF APRIL 19, 1775.</p>

<h2><a name="IN_PARLIAMENT" id="IN_PARLIAMENT"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">IN PARLIAMENT.</a></h2>

<p>The Treaty of Peace signed at Paris, Feb. 10,
1763, terminated the prolonged struggle between
England and France, for supremacy in the New
World. For seven long years it had lasted, and
its cost had been <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'treasure and bood'">treasure and blood</ins>. Justly
proud were the British Colonies of the martial
success of their mother country, a goodly
part of which they had valorously won themselves.</p>

<p>During the war, and at its close, England had
been generous in remitting to the Colonial Treasuries
large sums in partial liquidation of the war
expenses advanced by them; but subsequently
it was esteemed wise, by a majority of her statesmen,
to gradually replace such sums in the
royal coffers, by a system of colonial taxation
very similar to modern methods of raising war
revenues. In the abstract this fact was not
particularly disagreeable to the colonists, for
the necessity was admitted, but the arbitrary
method of levying those taxes was bitterly contested.</p>

<p>England's Parliament claimed the right to tax
the distant Colonies even as it taxed the neighboring
Boroughs, and as a commencement of its
financial plan enacted a Stamp Act, so called,
to take effect Nov. 1, 1765, similar in intent and
working, to the modern revenue stamp of our
Government. These stamps were to be purchased
of the Crown's officers and affixed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
certain articles of merchandise and in denominations
according to a schedule of taxable value.</p>

<p>The opposition to this Act was immediate,
continuous, and bitter in the extreme, and the
result was that it was repealed March 18, 1766.</p>

<p>The next move on the part of the Mother
Country was the passage of a Military Act
which provided for the partial subsistence of
armed troops on the Colonies. Violent opposition
to this was also immediate and general, but
without avail. In Boston one result was a conflict
between the troops and the inhabitants on
March 5, 1770, and now referred to as the
Boston Massacre.</p>

<p>In June, 1767, another Act was passed, taxing
tea and other commodities, which was repealed
April 12, 1770, on all articles except the tea.
Large consignments were sent to America. Ships
thus laden that arrived in New York were sent
back with their full cargoes. At Charleston
the tea was landed but remained unsold. At
Boston, a party disguised as Indians threw it
from the ship into the sea.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Parliament in consequence
passed the Boston Port Bill, March 7,
1774, closing Boston as a commercial port, and
removing the Custom House to Salem in another
harbor a dozen miles or more northward up the
coast.</p>

<p>This Act went into effect June 1, 1774, and
was immediately felt by all classes, for all commerce
ceased. Boston merchants became poor,
and Boston poor became beggars. The hand of
relief, however, was extended, even from beyond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the sea. The City of London in its corporate
capacity subscribed £30,000<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. In America the
assistance was liberal and speedy. George
Washington headed a subscription paper with
£50<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>These severe measures of Parliament, with
their natural effect of ruin and starvation among
the people of America, served to stimulate a
feeling of insubordination, and hatred of the
Mother Country, from which crystalized the
First Continental Congress which assembled at
Philadelphia, Sept. 5, 1774, soon followed by the
First Provincial Congress of Massachusetts
which met at Salem, Oct. 7, of the same year.</p>

<p>On the question of Colonial Government
Great Britain and her American colonies were
not divided by the Atlantic Ocean, for on the
American side the Crown had its ardent supporters,
while on the other side friends of the
American cause were almost as numerous as
were the oppressors. We have seen how the
great City of London contributed liberally to
the Bostonians, shut off from the world by the
Port Bill, and on the floor of Parliament many
gifted orators espoused the American cause.</p>

<p>With prophetic eloquence the Lord Mayor,
Mr. Wilkes, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"This I know, a successful resistance is a
revolution, not a rebellion.... Who can tell,
sir, whether in consequence of this day's violent
and mad Address to his Majesty, the scabbard
may not be thrown away by them as well as by
us?... But I hope the just vengeance of the
people will overtake the authors of these pernicious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
councils, and the loss of the first province
of the empire be speedily followed by the loss of
the heads of those ministers who advised these
wicked and fatal measures."<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Lord Chatham in his motion to withdraw the
troops from Boston, said:</p>

<p>"As an American I would recognize to England
her supreme right of regulating commerce
and navigation: as an Englishman by birth and
principle I recognize to the Americans their supreme
unalienable right in their property; a
right in which they are justified in the defence
of to the last extremity."<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The Corporation of the City of London passed
a vote of thanks to Chatham, and to those who
supported him for having offered to the House
of Lords a plan to conciliate the differences with
America.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>When Lord North's unfriendly proposition
for conciliating America was introduced, it
naturally found an advocate in the loyal and
courtly Gen. Burgoyne&mdash;courtly but courageous;
loyal ever to his King but not blind to the
merits of the claims of the Colonists. While
modestly pledging his loyalty to the Crown, he
could not refrain from adding:</p>

<p>"There is a charm in the very wanderings
and dreams of liberty that disarms an Englishman's
anger."<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In the debate on the bill for restraining the
Trade and Commerce of the English Colonies,
Lord Camden asked:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are the 10,000 men you have just
voted out to Boston? Merely to save General
Gage from the disgrace and destruction of being
sacked in his entrenchments. It is obvious,
my Lords, that you cannot furnish armies or
treasure, competent to the mighty purpose of
subduing America.... It is impossible that
this petty island can continue in dependence
that mighty continent."<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Continuing, he drew a picture of American
union and American courage, that in the end
would prevail.</p>

<p>The Earl of Sandwich replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Suppose the colonists do abound in men,
what does that signify? They are raw, undisciplined,
cowardly men. I wish instead of
40 or 50,000 of these brave fellows, they would
produce in the field at least 200,000, the more
the better, the easier would be the conquest;
if they did not run away, they would starve
themselves into compliance with our measures."<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>And the Bill was passed.</p>

<p>One has but to read the stirring debates of
that memorable year in Parliament, over the
Petitions for Redress of Grievances from America;
over the Petitions for Reconciliation from
the Merchants of Bristol and of London; over
the Resolutions offered by its own members;
and over the addresses to them by their King;&mdash;to
realize that the great question of American
rights had almost as many, and surely as eloquent
advocates, there as here.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<h2><a name="THE_PROVINCIAL_CONGRESS" id="THE_PROVINCIAL_CONGRESS"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE PROVINCIAL CONGRESS.</a></h2>

<p>As we have seen, the First Continental Congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
assembled at Philadelphia, Sept. 5, 1774.
They met in Carpenter's Hall. The First
Provincial Congress of Massachusetts met at
Salem, Oct. 7, following. John Hancock was
chosen President. In its first set of Resolutions
it announced: "the necessity of its most vigorous
and immediate exertions for preserving the
freedom and constitution," of the Province.</p>

<p>The Royal Governor, Gen. Thos. Gage, had
issued his writs the first day of September, calling
upon the inhabitants to return representatives
to the Great and General Court to be convened
at Salem on the fifth of October. In the
meantime, becoming alarmed at the tumults
and disorders&mdash;the extraordinary resolves
passed by some of the Counties, the instructions
given by Boston and some other towns to
their representatives, and the general unhappy
condition of the Province, he determined that
the time was not auspicious for such a gathering,
and accordingly issued a proclamation countermanding
the call. However, ninety representatives
met on that day, waited loyally for the
Governor, and when he failed to appear, adjourned
to the next day, Oct. 6, and met as a
Convention, choosing John Hancock, Chairman.
Not much in the way of business was accomplished
on that day, and they adjourned again,
until the next, Oct. 7th, when they met and
declared themselves to be a Provincial Congress
and chose John Hancock, Permanent Chairman.</p>

<p>Thus the First Provincial Congress was,
strictly speaking a self-constituted body, with
not even the sanction of a popular vote. Yet
they felt secure in a popular support. They
could not pass laws, but they could resolve,
advise and recommend, and such acts were generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
heeded by a majority of their fellow
citizens.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The military organization of the Province was
equally without effective power, as they recognized
no real commanding officer of higher rank
than Colonel. It is true that the Congress had
nominated three general officers, but their real
powers to command were feeble. The minute
men and militia were enrolled by thousands,
but they were poorly equipped, without uniforms,
and without discipline. They marched
to Battle Road in company formation, but upon
arrival or very soon after, manœuvred and
fought as individuals simply.</p>

<p>The Second Provincial Congress, more nearly
an elective body than the First, realized their
own lack of authority over the people and
particularly over the military branch of their
constituents. They wrote to the Continental
Congress at Philadelphia, under date of May 16,
1775, stating that they were compelled to raise
an army; of their triumph at having one consisting
of their own countrymen; but they admitted
a lack of civil power to provide for, and control
it. And they asked for advice from the greater
congress which represented all the Colonies
as to the taking up and exercising of the necessary
powers of a civil government.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Let us, then, as we go forward with this narrative,
bear these facts in mind, that we may not
in this very first day of a new nation's struggle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
for liberty expect too much from those who,
indeed had the wisdom, had the strength, had
the courage and the skill, but greatly lacked
the first elements of a civil government or a
military force&mdash;discipline and efficiency.</p>

<p>The First Provincial Congress next met in
Concord, Oct. 11, 1774. Hancock was chosen
President, an office higher than Permanent
Chairman. Several following days were devoted
to public business. From there they addressed
a communication to Gen. Gage, wherein they
expressed the apprehensions excited in their
minds by the rigorous execution of the Port Bill;
by the alteration of the Charter; by the administration
of justice in the Colony; by the number
of troops in the capital [Boston]; and particularly
by the formidable and hostile preparations on
Boston Neck. And they asked, rather pointedly,
"whether an inattentive and unconcerned
acquiescence in such alarming, and menacing
measures would not evidence a state of insanity?"
They entreated him to reduce the
fortress at the entrance to Boston, and concluded
by assuring his Excellency that they had not
the least intention of doing any harm to his
Majesty's troops.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Four days later, Oct. 17, sitting at Cambridge,
they received his reply. It was altogether lacking
in satisfaction. He answered them as to the
fortification on Boston Neck, that "unless annoyed,"
it would "annoy nobody." And the
rest of his communication was equally unassuring.</p>

<p>Oct. 19, a committee was appointed to inquire
into the then present state and operations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of the British Army;<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and on Oct. 20, another
committee to report on what was necessary to
be done for the safety and defence of the
Province.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Matters were crystallizing very fast, for on
Oct. 24, a committee was appointed to consider
and report on the most proper time for the
Province to provide a stock of powder, ordnance
and ordnance stores. That same afternoon,
one of the members, Mr. Bliss, was ordered to
wait upon the Committee to ascertain their
reply. They quickly responded that their
opinion was that "<em>now</em>" was the proper time to
procure such a stock.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Another committee was
at once appointed to take into consideration and
determine the quantity and expense thereof.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>On the afternoon of the following day,
Oct. 25, the schedule was presented to the
Congress and one of its items called for 1000
barrels of powder, and the proposed expense
was £10,737. Items were added by the Congress
to increase the amount to £20,837. It
was likewise ordered "that all the matters which
shall come under consideration before this
Congress be kept secret."<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Oct. 26, it was resolved that a Committee of
Safety should be appointed, whose business it
should be "most carefully and diligently to
inspect and observe all and every such person
and persons as shall at any time, attempt or
enterprise the destruction, invasion, detriment
or annoyance of this province." And they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
should have the power to alarm, muster and
cause to be assembled with the utmost expedition
and completely armed for the defence,
such of the militia as they shall deem necessary
for its defence.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> And it was also resolved that
as the security of the lives, liberties and
properties of these inhabitants depend on their
skill in the art military and in their being
properly and effectively armed, it was therefore
recommended that they immediately provide
themselves therewith.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>On Oct. 27, Congress appointed a Committee
of Safety consisting of nine members, three
from Boston and six from the country, John
Hancock, Chairman, and also a Commissary, or
Committee of Supplies, consisting of five members.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
At a subsequent meeting on the same
day, Jedidiah Preble was elected to be chief in
command and Artemas Ward, second.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Oct. 27 a vote was passed recommending that
the inhabitants perfect themselves in the military
art.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> On that same day a committee was
appointed to wait upon his excellency the
governor to express their surprise at his active
warlike preparations, and to announce that their
constituents would not expect them to be
guided by his advice.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> But before the conclusion
of this session another resolution was
passed to the effect that the lives and liberties
of the inhabitants depended upon their knowledge
and skill in the military art.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The First Provincial Congress was dissolved
Dec. 10, 1774, every session of its deliberations
having been devoted to the Civil Rights and
Liberties of the People over which it had presided.</p>

<p>The Second Provincial Congress was convened
in Concord Feb. 1, 1775. One of its
earliest acts, Feb. 9, was to appoint Hon.
Jedidiah Preble, Hon. Artemas Ward, Col. Seth
Pomeroy, Col. John Thomas and Col. William
Heath, general officers.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The same day, in an
address to the Inhabitants of the Massachusetts
Bay they said, "Though we deprecate a rupture
with the Mother State, yet we must urge you to
every preparation for your necessary defence."<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Nor were the Indians neglected in these
strong appeals to the patriotism of the inhabitants
of the Massachusetts Bay, for under date
of April 1, 1775, an address was issued to
Johoiakin <ins class="corr" title="Errata change&mdash;Original text: 'Mothskin'">
Mothksin</ins> and the rest of the Indians
of Stockbridge, expressing great pleasure
that they were "willing to take up the hatchet,"
and announcing that Col. Paterson and Capt.
Goodridge should present each that had enlisted
a blanket and a ribbon. A committee was also
appointed to address the chief of the Mohawks.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>The Committee of Safety met for the first
time at the house of Capt. Stedman, in Cambridge,
Wednesday, Nov. 2, 1774, and organized,
as we have stated, with John Hancock, Chairman.
John Pigeon was chosen clerk. Their
first vote after organization was a recommendation
to the Committee of Supplies to procure as
soon as may be, 335 barrels of pork, 700 barrels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of flour, 20 tierces of rice, 300 bushels of peas,
and that these be distributed in Worcester and
Concord. On Nov. 8, following, in joint meeting
with the Committee on Supplies, the latter
was advised to procure all of the arms and
ammunition possible from the neighboring
provinces, and that they might with safety
engage to pay for the same on arrival.</p>

<p>At subsequent meetings various military
stores were liberally provided. With a unanimous
vote on Feb. 21, 1775, by both committees
in joint session, it was decided that the Committee
of Supplies should purchase all kinds of
military stores sufficient for an army of 15,000
men.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> It did not then seem to them as if a
peaceful solution of the estrangement were
longer possible.</p>

<p>The last meeting of the Provincial Congress
before the battle, was held in Concord, April 15,
and when it adjourned it was until May 10.
But considering "the great uncertainty of the
present times," it was provided, however, that a
call might issue for an earlier assembling. Only
two days elapsed before apprehensions of immediate
danger arose, which grew so intense, that
Richard Devens on the 18th, issued a summons
for immediate assembling at Concord. Although
it was circulated with the greatest dispatch
many of the members could not have
learned of it before the marching of the British
troops on that same night from Boston Common.</p>

<p>The meeting was finally assembled on April 22,
and quickly adjourned to Watertown, evidently
to be in closer touch with the thrilling events
that had so dramatically opened.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<h2><a name="BRITISH_FORCES_IN_BOSTON" id="BRITISH_FORCES_IN_BOSTON"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">BRITISH FORCES IN BOSTON.</a></h2>

<p>General Thomas Gage, Commander of the
British forces in America, and successor of
Thomas Hutchinson as Governor of Massachusetts
Bay, landed in Boston, May 13, 1774.
Inspired by a hope that his administration
might soften the feeling of resentment against
the Mother Country, by annulling some of its
causes, his reception on the 17th was dignified
and cordial. He was greeted with cheers by
the multitude, the firing of salutes in his honor,
and a lavish banquet in Faneuil Hall.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> A few
weeks before he had assured his king that the
Americans "will be lions while we are lambs;
but if we take the resolute part they will prove
very weak."<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>His military force then in Boston was less
than 4,000 men,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and consisted of the Fourth
or King's Own; Fifth; Tenth; Seventeenth:
3 Companies of the Eighteenth; Twenty-second;
Twenty-third; Thirty-eighth; Forty-third;
Forty-fourth; Forty-seventh; Fifty-second;
Fifty-ninth; Sixty-third; Sixty-fourth; six
or eight Companies of Artillery; and six or eight
Companies of Marines, numbering 460, under
Major Pitcairn.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Major Gen. Heath is the authority for the
statement that the Provincial Congress appointed
a committee to make inquiry into the
state of operation of the British Army in Boston,
and on the 20th of March, they reported that
there were about 2,850 men distributed as
follows: Boston Common, about 1,700; Fort
Hill, 400; Boston Neck, 340; in Barracks at the
Castle, about 330; King Street, 80; that they
were erecting works at Boston Neck on both
sides of the way, well constructed and well
executed. The works were in forwardness and
mounted with ten brass and two iron cannon.
The old fortification at the entrance of the
town was replaced and rendered much stronger
by the addition of timber and earth to the
parapet, and ten pieces of iron cannon were
mounted on the old platform. A block house
had been brought from Governor's Island and
was being erected on the south side of the
Neck.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>But a short time was required to show that
in every political question Gen. Gage was loyal
to his king. Accordingly throughout the Province
the press, the pulpit, the expression of
opinion in public meetings, while professing
loyalty to the king personally, were extremely
bitter against his representative in command.</p>

<p>Conventions were held in the various Counties
of the Province, the earliest one being in Berkshire
County, July 6, 1774, followed by the one
in Worcester County, Aug. 9. Resolutions
were passed at each, professing loyalty to the
king, but remonstrating strongly against Parliament.
It was left for the Middlesex County
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Convention, August 30, to pass resolutions that
rang throughout the Province. While also
professing loyalty to the King their final sentence
was:</p>

<p>"No danger shall affright, no difficulties intimidate
us; and if in support of our rights we
are called to encounter even death, we are yet
undaunted, sensible that he can never die too
soon, who lays down his life in support of the
laws and liberty of his country."</p>

<p>These resolutions were passed by a vote of
146 yeas against 4 nays.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Although the town of Boston itself was the
headquarters of Gen. Gage, and his soldiers
were parading in its streets, and encamping on
its Common, the patriots had by no means
deserted it. There were several secret societies
who made it their business to watch for and
report hostile movements and plans. These
were the "North End Caucus;" the "South End
Caucus;" the "Middle District Caucus;" and
the "Long Room Club;" all of which owned
allegiance to the "Sons of Liberty," a body
which acted in the capacity of a higher council
and which kept itself in close communication
with similar organizations outside of this Province.
Members of these various bodies paraded
the streets nightly, that any sudden or unusual
movement of the army might be at once reported.
Paul Revere belonged to one or more
of these, and was active in patriotic work.</p>

<p>Nor was Gen. Gage idle in acquiring information
about the Provincial Army being assembled,
and the topographical features of the country
around Boston. His troops were especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
trained by marches, over the highways in the
vicinity,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and his spies brought him maps and
reports from the scenes of his possible future
operations. The two that acted for him in this
secret service were Capt. Brown of the 52nd
regiment, and Ensign <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'D'Bernicre'">De Bernicre</ins> of the 10th
regiment. They were disguised in "brown
clothes" with "reddish handkerchiefs" tied
about their necks, and were accompanied by
a servant. All three were well armed.</p>

<p>Gen. Gage's instructions to them, under date
of Feb. 22, 1775, called for description of the
roads, rivers, and hills; available places for encampments;
whether or not the churches and
church yards were advantageous spots to take
post in and capable of being made defensible.
They were also told that information would be
useful in reference to the provisions, forage, etc.,
that could be obtained at the several places they
should pass through.</p>

<p>Their first trip was to Worcester, in the
latter part of February, and their next one to
Concord, for which place they set out on
March 20, passing through Roxbury, Brookline,
and Weston, where they stopped at the Jones
Tavern.</p>

<p>Then they proceeded through Sudbury,
crossed over the South Bridge into Concord
village, where they were entertained by a Mr.
Bliss, a friend of the royal government.</p>

<p>Wherever they went their mission was known
in spite of their disguises. They succeeded,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
however, in bringing back to Gen. Gage a very
tolerable description of the country, and so fulfilled
their mission. In Concord, especially,
they located many of the provincial military
stores, information particularly useful to the
invading force on April 19th.</p>

<p>Having thus possessed himself of sufficient
data, Gen. Gage then laid his plans for a midnight
march to Lexington and Concord with
the view, possibly, of capturing Hancock and
Adams, who were known to be at the former
place, and especially of destroying all the war-like
supplies that had been gathered at Concord.</p>

<p>April 15, the grenadiers and light infantry
had been relieved from duty, with the excuse
that they were to learn a new exercise. That
night, about twelve o'clock, boats belonging to
the transports which had been hauled up for
repairs were launched and moored under the
sterns of the men-o-war.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The <i>Somerset</i> was
anchored near the Charlestown Ferry.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> These
movements awakened the suspicions of Dr.
Warren, who lost no time in notifying Hancock
and Adams, then at Lexington. On the afternoon
of April 18th, he learned from several
sources that the British were about to move.
A gunsmith named Jasper, learned as much
from a British sergeant and lost no time in
informing Col. Waters of the Committee of
Safety, who in turn gave the news to Warren.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
John Ballard, connected with the stable in
Milk Street, overheard some one in the Province
House remark that there would "be hell to pay
tomorrow;" a remark so full of significance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
that he reported it to a friend of liberty in Ann
Street, thought to have been William Dawes,
who in turn reported it to Paul Revere.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>That night Gen. Gage despatched ten or more
sergeants, partially disguised, along the highways
in Cambridge and beyond, towards
Concord. They were instructed to intercept
any passers-by, and so prevent his intended
movement from becoming known. A party of
his officers dined at Wetherby's Tavern<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> in
Menotomy (now Arlington), where also met
that day the Committee of Safety and Committee
of Supplies, some of whom, Mr. Gerry,
Col. Orne and Col. Lee, remained to pass the
night.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Solomon Brown of Lexington, a young man
nineteen years old, was the first to report in that
town the unusual occurrence of so many officers
along the highways in the night, and it was surmised
there that the capture of Hancock and
Adams was intended. Brown was returning
home from Boston when they passed him on
the road. Somehow gaining the front again
he rode rapidly into Lexington village and
reported what he had seen. Sergeant Munroe
and eight men were sent to guard the parsonage
where the patriot statesmen were stopping, and
Solomon Brown, Jonathan Loring, and Elijah
Sanderson, all members of Captain Parker's
Company of Minute Men, were despatched to
watch the officers after they had passed through
Lexington toward Concord. They followed
them on horseback into Lincoln, about two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and a half miles from Lexington village, where
they were ambushed by the ones they were
following, and taken prisoners. It was then
about 10 o'clock in the evening of April 18th.
They were detained until Revere was also
captured at the same place a few hours later,
early in the morning of the 19th.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<h2><a name="THE_BRITISH_START_FOR_LEXINGTON" id="THE_BRITISH_START_FOR_LEXINGTON"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE BRITISH START FOR LEXINGTON
AND CONCORD.</a></h2>

<p>The grenadiers and light infantry under command
of Lieut.-Col. Francis Smith, of the 10th
Regiment, augmented by a detachment of
Marines under Major John Pitcairn, assembled
at the foot of Boston Common, on the evening
of April 18th, and at about half-past ten o'clock
embarked for Lechmere Point, or, as it was often
called at that time, Phip's Farm, in East Cambridge.
They numbered about eight hundred
men.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The "Foot of the Common," was not far from
the present corner of Boylston and Charles
Streets, and just there was the shore line of the
Back Bay, a large body of water opening out
into the Charles River. Since then the Bay has
been filled in and is now an attractive residential
district bearing still its ancient aquatic name
however.</p>

<p>The transportation was by means of the row
boats connected with the British men-of-war
and transports, and was thus necessarily slow,
and undoubtedly required several trips. It
seems probable that their course was westerly
a little way, along the present Boylston Street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
then northerly along the present Arlington
Street, into the Charles River and across to
Lechmere Point, a distance of about a mile and
a quarter.</p>

<p>They landed in the marshes nearly opposite
the Court House on Second Street, for East
Cambridge also was much smaller then than
now. The water was too shallow to allow the
heavily loaded boats to reach dry land, so
the troops waded knee deep to the shore. There
they were halted in a "dirty road," as one of the
British officers present termed it,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and detained
still longer, that each might receive a day's
rations and thirty-six rounds of ammunition.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<h2><a name="THE_MESSENGERS_OF_ALARM" id="THE_MESSENGERS_OF_ALARM"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE MESSENGERS OF ALARM.</a></h2>

<p>The invading army safely across the Charles
River was now really on its way, but with all its
precautions for secrecy, its coming was even at
that moment being heralded in every direction.
The ever-vigilant Sons of Liberty had noticed
the unusual movements of the troops after dark,
and so informed Dr. Warren. He quickly
summoned William Dawes and Paul Revere.
Dawes arriving first was the first to start, and
his route to Lexington was through Roxbury.
So to him belongs the credit of being the first
messenger out of Boston bearing the alarm of
the British invasion. Paul Revere came soon
after and was carried over the Charles River
considerably farther down than the British
soldiers were crossing, and landed in Charlestown.
His route to Lexington was much
shorter than the one through Roxbury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Warren had arranged with these two
men for this especial work, and so they were
ready. Dawes had left home that afternoon,
not even confiding to his wife his intention. Immediately
after the embarkation he was ready
and on his way. He managed to elude the
guard at Boston Neck by passing out with
some soldiers. His ride was then through
Roxbury, Brookline, Brighton, over the Charles
River there by bridge into Cambridge, at
Harvard Square, and thence directly on to
Lexington. So much longer was his route than
Revere's, that he did not reach there until half
an hour later than Revere did, and then found
that Hancock and Adams had been alarmed.
The work of William Dawes was efficient over
the route he traveled. In Lexington, Revere
waited for Dawes, and from there onwards
toward Concord they traveled together. It is
to be regretted that a more detailed account of
the ride of William Dawes cannot be given.
But momentary flashes of light reveal his
course and his work. Revere left a narrative of
his ride, and historians have fallen into the error
of supposing him to be the only messenger with
the warlike tidings. As we progress with this
narrative we shall surmise that William Dawes
and Paul Revere were but two out of many, for
the exciting news radiated in every direction,
and could only have been borne by riders
equally as patriotic and fleet as those two.</p>

<p>The previous Sunday evening Paul Revere
had been out to Lexington, for a conference
with Hancock and Adams, and on his return
that same night to Charlestown he had agreed
with Col. Conant and some others to display<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
lanterns in the North Church steeple, if the
troops should march; one lantern if they went
by land, which meant out over Boston Neck,
through Roxbury, Brookline, and Brighton, into
Harvard Square, Cambridge; and two, if they
crossed the Charles River in boats and landed
at Lechmere Point in East Cambridge. This
arrangement was made because it was surmised
that no messenger would be allowed to leave
Boston with the news while the troops were
leaving.</p>

<p>When Revere left Warren his first duty was
to call upon Capt. John Pulling, Jr.,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and
arrange for the signal lanterns. Then he went
to his home in North Square for his boots and
surtout, and from there to where his boat was
moored beneath a cob-wharf, near the present
Craigie Bridge, in the north part of the town.
Two friends accompanied him, Joshua Bentley
and Thomas Richardson.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Their point of starting was not far from the
then Charlestown Ferry, the boats of which
were drawn up nightly at nine o'clock. Out in
the Charles River was anchored the <i>Somerset</i>, a
British man-of-war. It was young flood, and
the moon was rising.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Fearing that the noise
of the oars in the oar-locks might alarm the
sentry, Revere despatched one of his companions
for something to muffle them with, who
soon returned with a petticoat, yet warm from
the body of a fair daughter of Liberty who was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
glad to contribute to the cause.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Rowing out
into the river and passing to the eastward of
the <i>Somerset</i> they looked back and there shining
from the tall steeple of Christ Church, the Old
North, were two signal lanterns.</p>

<p>Far up into the valleys of the Mystic and the
Charles, those twinkling rays gleamed, and
their meaning picked up wherever it fell, was
carried still farther to the remoter hamlets and
villages beyond the hills.</p>

<p>When Capt. Pulling left Paul Revere he
proceeded at once to the home of the sexton of
Christ Church, Robert Newman, who lived on
Salem St., opposite Bennett St. Pulling was
vestryman of the church and when he demanded
the keys of Newman they were handed to him
without question. Pulling proceeded to the
church, climbed the belfry stairs, hung two
lighted lanterns out of the highest little window,
forty-two feet above the sidewalk,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> descended
and made his exit through a window, and so
escaped unnoticed.</p>

<p>These lanterns were seen by all who looked,
and quickly British <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'soliders'">soldiers</ins> sought out the
sexton and placed him under arrest. His
denial of any knowledge as to who displayed
the lanterns was believed, and he was released.
Pulling, disguised as a sailor, escaped from
Boston in a fishing vessel, landed in Nantucket,
and did not return until after the siege.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Revere and his two companions reached the
Charlestown shore in safety. Their landing
place was near the old battery at Gage's
Wharf, not far from No. 85 of the present
Water St., near City Square. They were met
by Col. Conant and several others, who reported
that the lanterns had been seen and
interpreted. While Revere was waiting for
his horse, which was furnished by Deacon
Larkin, Richard Devens, one of the Committee
of Safety, came and told Revere that as he
came down the road from Lexington after
sundown that evening, he met ten British
officers, all well mounted and armed, going up
the road.</p>

<p>It was about 11 o'clock when Revere started
from the Charlestown shore on his mission to
alarm. He had intended to proceed over
Charlestown Neck, through Somerville to Cambridge
and thence to Lexington. Just such a
ride as his had been anticipated, for he had
gone but a short distance along the Cambridge
road beyond Charlestown Neck, when he perceived
two mounted British officers halted under
the shadows of a tree in a narrow part of the
road.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Near by was the gibbet where Mark,
the negro slave, executed in 1755 for poisoning
his master, hung in chains for about fifteen
years.</p>

<p>Revere wheeled his horse and made his
escape, retreating along the road to the Neck,
then turning into the Mystic road, which runs
over Winter Hill into Medford.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> There he
awakened the Captain of the Minute Men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Isaac Hall, and alarmed almost if not every
house on the way to Lexington. His road was
through West Medford to Arlington Centre,
there turning at the Cooper Tavern northwesterly
towards Lexington. He reached the
parsonage in Lexington at midnight, which
then stood on the westerly side of the Bedford
Road about a quarter of a mile beyond the
Common.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Within were sleeping John Hancock
and Samuel Adams. Keeping guard outside
were eight men under Sergeant William
Munroe, who cautioned Revere not to make
too much noise, lest he should awaken the
family, who had just retired.</p>

<p>"Noise," exclaimed Revere, "You'll have
noise enough before long. The regulars are
coming out."</p>

<p>But he had already alarmed the inmates,
for the window was raised, and the parson,
Mr. Clarke, inquired who was there. Revere,
without answering the question, said he wished
to see Mr. Hancock.</p>

<p>"Come in, Revere," exclaimed Hancock,
who also had been awakened, "we are not afraid
of you."</p>

<p>Half an hour later Dawes rode up from his
longer ride from Boston.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> They partook of
refreshments and together set out for Concord.
Not far beyond Lexington Common they were
overtaken by a young man, Dr. Samuel Prescott,
whose home was in Concord. That
evening he had been visiting the young lady
to whom he was engaged to be married, Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Mulliken of Lexington. Revere spoke of the
ten officers that Devens had met, and of the
probability that they would attempt to stop
them before they should reach Concord. It
was planned to alarm every house on the way.
Dr. Prescott volunteered to remain with the
two riders, as his acquaintance with the people
along the road might be needed to vouch for the
genuineness of the message.</p>

<p>His company was accepted and very welcome.
They rode along, alarming each household, a
little over two and a half miles from Lexington
Common. Dawes and Prescott had stopped at a
house to arouse the inmates, and Revere was
about a hundred rods ahead, when he saw
two men in the highway. He called loudly for
Dawes and Prescott to come up, thinking to
capture them, but just then two more appeared,
coming through the bars from a pasture on the
right, or northerly side of the road, where they
had been standing in the shadow of a tree.
They proved to be officers of the British Army.
Dawes wheeled his horse back towards Lexington
and escaped. Prescott and Revere attempted
to ride towards Concord, but were intercepted
and ordered to move through the bars into the
pasture or have their brains blown out. They
preferred to do as ordered, but when a little
way inside, Prescott said to Revere, "put on,"
and immediately jumped his horse over the
stone wall at his left and disappeared down the
farm road leading into a ravine where rise the
headwaters of the Shawsheen River. He knew
the location well, and easily followed the road
through the thicket until it comes out on the
Concord road again, a half mile or so beyond.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Revere, not so well acquainted with the location,
headed towards the dense woods on the lower
edge of the pasture, thinking to dismount
within their shadows and escape on foot. Six
more British officers were in hiding there, and
they easily seized his horse's bridle and with
pistols levelled at his breast ordered him to
dismount.</p>

<p>And so there in Lincoln, about two and one-half
miles beyond Lexington, ended the midnight
rides of William Dawes and Paul Revere.
Prescott had gone on to continue the alarm,
Dawes had retreated towards Lexington, and
Revere was a prisoner. While the latter was
being secured, three or four of the officers
started up the road in pursuit of Dawes, who
galloped his horse furiously up to a farm house,
where he reined in so suddenly that he was
thrown to the ground. With great presence of
mind he shouted loudly for assistance, exclaiming:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hallo, my boys. I've got two of 'em."</p>

<p>The British in pursuit supposing they were
ambushed in turn, retreated and made good
their escape. Dawes rose from the ground and
found himself quite alone, for the house, which
might have contained a force of American
minute men, was empty and deserted. He
mounted his horse and rode leisurely away.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>But Revere was not the only prisoner captured
by the British officers in Lincoln. Solomon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Brown, Jonathan Loring, and Elijah
Sanderson, all of Lexington, had been passing
along at that place about ten o'clock, the previous
evening (for it is now after midnight,
April 19th), and were detained and being held
as prisoners when Revere was added. A one-handed
peddler, Allen by name, was also a
prisoner, having been captured after Brown
and his two companions. For some reason he
was not long delayed, but released, and went
his way.</p>

<p>Revere was ordered to dismount and one
of the six proceeded to examine him, asking his
name; if he was an express; and what time he
left Boston. He answered each question truthfully,
and added that the troops in passing the
river had got aground; that he had alarmed the
country on the way up; and that 500 Americans
would soon be present. This was rather disturbing
news for his captors, and the one who
had acted as spokesman rode to the four who
had first halted the messengers. After a short
conference the five returned on a gallop, and
one of them, whom Revere afterwards found to
be Major Mitchell of the Fifth Regiment,
clapped a pistol to his head, and, calling him by
name, said he should ask him some questions,
and if they were not answered truthfully, he
should blow his brains out. Revere answered
the many questions, some of them new ones
and some the same as he had already answered.
He was then directed to mount, and the whole
party proceeded towards Lexington. After
riding about a mile Major Mitchell instructed
the officer leading Revere's horse to turn him
over to the Sergeant who was instructed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
blow the prisoner's brains out, if he attempted
to escape, or if any insults were offered to his
captors on the way.</p>

<p>When within half a mile of Lexington meeting-house,
on the Common, they heard a gun fired,
and Major Mitchell, beginning to feel alarmed,
asked Revere its cause, who told him it was an
alarm. The other prisoners were then ordered
to dismount, one of the officers cut the bridles
of their horses and drove them away. Revere
asked to be discharged, also, but his request was
not heeded.</p>

<p>Coming a little nearer to the meeting-house,
within sight of it, in fact, they heard a volley
of gun shots, whereupon Major Mitchell called
a halt, and questioned Revere again, as to
the distance to Cambridge, and if there were
two roads going there, etc. He then ordered
him to dismount and exchange horses with the
Sergeant, who cut away bridle and saddle from
his own, which was a small one and well nigh
exhausted, before completing the exchange.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>The officers then hastily disappeared down
the road towards Lexington meeting-house, and
Revere made his way, probably afoot, across
the old cemetery and the adjacent pasture near
Lexington Common, to the parsonage on
Bedford Road, where he had left Hancock and
Adams a few hours earlier.</p>

<p>The entire distance that Revere rode, from
the Charlestown shore to the spot in Lincoln
where he was captured, and back to Lexington
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Common, was between 18 and 19 miles, and
the elapsed time nearly four hours.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<h2><a name="FLIGHT_OF_HANCOCK_AND_ADAMS" id="FLIGHT_OF_HANCOCK_AND_ADAMS"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">FLIGHT OF HANCOCK AND ADAMS.</a></h2>

<p>The narration of Revere's adventures was
eagerly listened to by the patriots assembled at
the parsonage. Hancock and Adams were
urged to flee by their friends. Hancock was
loth to do so, but Adams persuaded him that
their duties were executive rather than military,
so they prepared for a hasty retreat. Their
flight commenced in a chaise driven by Jonas
Clarke, son of the minister.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Mr. Lowell,
Hancock's secretary, and Paul Revere, accompanied
them for two miles into Burlington,
where they stopped, first at the house of Mr.
Reed for a little time, and then continued
farther on to the home of Madame Jones,
widow of Rev. Thomas Jones and of Rev. Mr.
Marrett. Then they sent back to the parsonage
for Hancock's betrothed, Dorothy Quincy, his
aunt, Mrs. Hancock, and lastly, a "fine salmon,"
which had been presented to them for dinner,
and naturally forgotten as they started on their
flight. All of these arrived in due time, and
then Revere and Lowell returned to Lexington
Common, with the intention of rescuing a
trunk and its contents which belonged to
Hancock, and which he had left at the Buckman
Tavern.</p>

<p>The fugitives were about to sit down to the
salmon dinner when a Lexington farmer, in great
excitement, rushed in exclaiming, that the
British were coming, and that his wife was even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
then in "eternity." The salmon dinner was
abandoned, and the flight continued under the
guidance of Mr. Marrett, to Amos Wyman's,
where they finally sat down to a dinner, not of
salmon, but of cold salt pork and potatoes
served on a wooden tray. The last stopping
place was just over the boundary line of Woburn
into Billerica, easterly from the present Lowell
Turnpike, and northerly from the Lexington
parsonage about four miles.</p>

<p>Samuel Adams had left behind him somewhere
on the road his immortal saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What a glorious morning for America is
this."<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Revere and Lowell reached Buckman Tavern,
and there learned from a man who had just
come up the road that the troops were within
two miles. They proceeded to a chamber for
the trunk, which they secured, and looking out
of the window towards Boston, saw the King's
soldiers but a little way off. They quickly
made their exit from the Tavern, passed along
the Common through Captain Parker's Company,
or rather a small part of it, and heard his
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let the troops pass by and don't molest
them without they begin first."<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>When a little farther along, "<em>not half gun
shot off</em>," as Revere expresses it, he heard a
single gun, turned and saw the smoke of it
rising just in front of the troops, heard them
give a great shout, saw them run a few paces,
heard irregular firing as of an advance guard,
and then firing by platoons.</p>

<p>The American Revolution had indeed commenced.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<h2><a name="ALARMS_IN_OTHER_PLACES" id="ALARMS_IN_OTHER_PLACES"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">ALARMS IN OTHER PLACES.</a></h2>

<p>It must not be imagined that information of
the night march of the troops was known only
along the highway to their destination in
Concord. There were fleet messengers in every
direction, through the Counties of Middlesex
and Essex and Norfolk. Those lanterns in the
North Church steeple meant as much to many
others as to those on the Charlestown shore.
But few details of their rides have been left to
us. Yet everywhere the hoof-beats, the shadowy
form of the horseman&mdash;his cry of alarm,
the drums&mdash;the bells&mdash;the guns&mdash;the assembling
of the minute men,&mdash;their hurried
march towards that one long and thin highway
from Boston to Concord; some of these are
known, and can be written of, as a part of the
record of that day.</p>

<p>Northerly along the coast the alarm went.
At Lynn, ten miles away, the inhabitants were
awakened in the early morn of the 19th, by the
information that 800 British soldiers had left
Boston in the night and were proceeding towards
Concord. Many immediately set out for
the scene of the invasion, singly and in little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
bands, without waiting to march in company
file.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>At Woburn, ten miles from Boston, a man
rode up to the house of Mr. Douglass, about an
hour before sunrise&mdash;and knocked loudly at
the door, saying:</p>

<p>"There is an alarm&mdash;the British are coming
out; and if there is any soldier in the house
he must turn out and repair to Lexington as
soon as possible."<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Such is the sworn statement of Robert
Douglass, who lived in Portland, Maine, but
who was then staying at his father's home in
Woburn. He arose and started for Lexington,
four miles away, with Sylvanus Wood. And
Douglass, upon arrival, paraded with Capt.
Parker's Company. Col. Loammi Baldwin
resided in Woburn, and entered in his diary
some of his experiences of the day. Under date
of April 19, he says that in the morning a little
before the break of day, they were alarmed by
Mr. Stedman's express from Cambridge. With
others he hurried to Lexington, but could not
reach the Common in time to participate in the
opening struggle. They saw the stains of
blood on the ground, hurried on to Lincoln, and
at Tanner's Brook commenced to harass the
British on their return.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>In Reading, twelve miles from Boston, alarm
guns were fired, just at sunrise. Edmund Foster
in a letter to Col. Daniel Shattuck, of Concord,
dated March 10, 1825, speaks at length of his
personal experiences. Following the guns came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
a post, bringing the information that the
Regulars had gone to Concord.</p>

<p>In Danvers, sixteen miles away, news of the
British advance was given at about 9 o'clock,
and was communicated to the citizens by bells
and drums, who responded by thronging to the
rendezvous near the Old South Church at the
bend of the Boston Road. Women were there,
not with entreaty, but to fasten on the belt,
and gird on the sword.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>At Andover, twenty-five miles away, the
alarm was given at about sunrise, and minute-men
were ready to march for Concord at about
10 o'clock. On their way through Tewksbury
they learned that eight Americans had been
killed at Lexington; and at Billerica, that the
British were killing Americans at Concord.
Reaching Bedford they learned more definitely
that two Americans had been killed at Concord,
and that the enemy was falling back.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Lexington lies in a northwesterly direction
from Boston, at a distance of about eleven miles.
At that time it was the abiding place of John
Hancock and Samuel Adams who were stopping
at the parsonage of Rev. Jonas Clarke. It was
then supposed that one of the objects of Gen.
Gage was to effect their capture, and that his
other object was the destruction of military
stores at Concord. Possibly the first intimation
that Lexington had of the proposed hostile
visit of Gage's troops was communicated by a
young man, Solomon Brown, who had been to
Boston, on market business, and on his return
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
had passed a patrol of British officers. There
were ten of them, it was late in the afternoon,
or early evening of April 18, and they were
riding away from Boston towards Lexington,
which seemed out of harmony with their ordinary
way of riding back to Boston at night.
Mr. Brown kept somewhat near them along
the road for awhile, that he might the better
determine their intentions, allowing them to
pass and repass him several times. Having at
last satisfied himself that their mission meant
more than a pleasure sortie into the country,
he gained the lead once more, and when out of
their sight rode rapidly to Lexington and
reported his observations to Orderly Sergeant
William Munroe, proprietor of Munroe's Tavern.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>These ten officers riding in advance must have
known that actual hostilities were at hand, for
they not only detained travelers on the highway,
but deliberately insulted a large number of the
inhabitants along the road. Three or four of
them, at least, went far beyond the behavior of
military men in time of peace, for as they rode
into Lexington, they stopped at the house of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Matthew Mead, entered and helped themselves
to the prepared family supper of brown bread
and baked beans. Mrs. Mead and her daughter,
Rhoda, were within, and Mr. Mead and two
sons were absent. This Lexington home was at
the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Woburn
Street, where the Russell House now stands.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Quickly following Solomon Brown's message
came a written one, directed to John Hancock,
sent by Elbridge Gerry, one of the Committee
of Supplies, then sitting at the Black Horse
Tavern in Menotomy. It was practically to
the same effect, "that eight or nine officers of the
King's troops were seen, just before night,
passing the road towards Lexington, in a musing,
contemplative posture; and it was supposed
they were out upon some evil design."<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Hancock at once replied to Gerry that it was
said the officers had gone to Concord, and that
he would send word thither.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>But naturally it was surmised that the capture
of Hancock and Adams was intended, so a
guard of eight men, under Sergeant William
Munroe, was stationed around the home of
Rev. Jonas Clarke. About forty of the members
of Captain Parker's Company gathered at the
Buckman Tavern after the mounted officers
passed through Lexington,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and it was deemed
best that scouts should be sent out to follow
them. Accordingly Solomon Brown, Jonathan
Loring, and Elijah Sanderson volunteered to
act,&mdash;and they started about 9 o'clock in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
evening.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> As we have previously written, they
were ambushed and captured at about 10 o'clock
on the road towards Concord, in the town of
Lincoln, by the same ones they had set out to
follow.</p>

<p>Soon after the arrival of Paul Revere between
12 and 1 o'clock in the morning of April 19,
with the intelligence of the starting of the King's
troops, Captain Parker assembled his company
on the Common. The roll was called and they
were instructed to load with powder and ball.
One of the messengers who had been sent towards
Boston, returned and reported that he
could not discover any troops on the way out,
which raised some doubts as to their coming.
It was between 1 and 2 o'clock when they were
dismissed with instructions, however, to remain
in the immediate neighborhood, for quick
response to the call of the drum. Many of
them adjourned to Buckman's Tavern, and
the others, living in the immediate vicinity, returned
to their homes.</p>

<p>Between daylight and sunrise Capt. Thaddeus
Bowman rode up, and reported that the
regulars were near. The drum was beat,
and Captain Parker's little band assembled on
the Common.</p>

<p>The soldiers of the King were but one hundred
rods down the road.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Bedford an adjoining town to Lexington, and
about fifteen miles from Boston, was alarmed
on the evening of the 18th, by Nathan Munroe
and Benjamin Tidd, both of Lexington, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
had been sent there by Captain Parker because
of the suspicious actions of the British officers
on their way to Concord. Munroe and Tidd
aroused the town, and some of the minute-men
rallied at the tavern kept by Nathan Fitch, Jr.,
and were there served with light refreshments.
Captain Willson said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is a cold breakfast, boys, but we will give
the British a hot dinner. We'll have every
dog of them before night."<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The larger Bedford rally was at the oak tree
standing in the little triangle a few rods west
of the village, where the road to Concord
branches away from the road to Billerica.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Munroe and Tidd continued their alarm to
Meriam's Corner in Concord and returned to
Lexington in time to hear the first alarm bell
in the morning of the 19th, and witness the
assembling of Capt. Parker's Company. Munroe,
being a member joined the ranks, and Tidd
remained on or near the Common and was dispersed
with the rest.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Josiah Nelson, living in the northeast part of
Lincoln, was awakened on the night of the
18th, by horsemen passing up the road. Rushing
out partly dressed, to ascertain who they
were, he received a blow on his head from a
sword, cutting sufficiently to draw the blood.
He was seized and detained a little while by his
British captors, and when released had his
wound dressed, and hurried to Bedford and
gave the alarm in that town also.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Billerica, seventeen miles northwest from
Boston, probably received the alarm about two
o'clock, and when the encounter on Lexington
Common took place few if any families but
had heard the call to arms.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Concord, seventeen miles northwesterly from
Boston was first aroused by Dr. Samuel Prescott,
between one and two o'clock in the morning of
the 19th. He had just escaped from the
British, in Lincoln, at the time they captured
Revere. It was nearly three o'clock when the
alarm bell was rung, whereupon several posts
were despatched, who returning, brought the
news that the regulars were indeed coming;
that they had reached Lexington, and killed
six Americans, and then started for Concord.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
Capt. Minot's Company took possession of the
hill to the eastward above the meeting house,
and Capt. Brown's Company marched up the
road to meet the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Corporal Amos Barrett of Capt. David
Brown's Company has left a written statement
that he thinks one hundred and fifty minute-men
had assembled. His Company resolved
to go up the road towards Lexington and meet
the British. They accordingly marched a mile
or a mile and a half, when they saw them coming.
They halted and awaited them, and when
they were within one hundred rods were ordered
by their captain to about face. They marched
back to the village to the music of their fife and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
drum, the British following, also playing their
fifes and drums.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Brown's Company consolidated with Minot's,
and both took up a new position, a little farther
north on the adjoining hill, back of the town.
The British were so many more in number, that
it was thought prudent to still farther retire.
Accordingly the two companies marched down
the hill, over the North Bridge, distance three-quarters
of a mile from the village, and took a
new and stronger position on Punkatasset Hill,
a little more than a mile from the village, but
clearly overlooking it. There they welcomed
the reinforcements that were arriving from the
neighboring towns.</p>

<p>In Tewksbury, twenty miles northwesterly
from Boston, the alarm was given at about
2 o'clock in the morning. "The British are on
their way to Concord and I have alarmed all
the towns from Charlestown to here,"<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> were
the words that aroused Capt. John Trull, from
his slumber, who in turn fired his gun to arouse
Gen. Varnum, across the Merrimack River
over in Dracut, a signal previously agreed
upon between them. When Capt. Trull reached
the village his men were awaiting him and they
at once started for Concord. There were two
other Tewksbury companies commanded respectively
by Capt. Jonathan Brown and Capt.
Thomas Clark, who also responded to the
alarm.</p>

<p>In Acton, twenty-one miles northwesterly
from Boston, and the adjoining town to Concord
westerly, the alarm was given early in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
morning. Col. Francis Faulkner resided in
South Acton. His son, Francis, Jr., was lying
awake and listening to the clatter of a horse's
feet drawing nearer and nearer. Suddenly he
leaped from his bed and ran to his father's room,
adjoining, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Father, there's a horse coming on the full
run, and he's bringing news!"</p>

<p>His father had heard the horseman also, for
he was partly dressed with gun in hand. Across
the bridge and up to the house came the messenger.</p>

<p>"Rouse your minute-men, Mr. Faulkner, the
British are marching on Lexington and Concord."
And away he rode to spread the news.</p>

<p>Col. Faulkner, without completing his dress,
fired his gun three times as fast as he could load,
that being the preconcerted signal. Very
quickly a neighbor repeated it, and the boy, still
listening, heard a repetition many times, each
farther away. Thus was Acton aroused.</p>

<p>At the home of Col. Faulkner very soon
assembled Capt. Hunt's Company. Women
were there, too, to help as they might. Stakes
were driven into the lawn, kettles hung, fires
built, and a dinner for the soldiers soon cooked.
Some of the older boys were delighted to follow
on and carry it in saddle-bags, separately from
the minute-men, with instructions to take the
field roads if the British should be found occupying
the highways. Col. Faulkner marched away
with Capt. Hunt's Company, to take command
of the Middlesex Regiment, which he supposed
to be assembling at Concord.</p>

<p>The home of Capt. Davis, was about a mile
westerly from the meeting house in the centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of Acton, and about six miles from the North
Bridge in Concord. His Company were assembling
rapidly, and when about twenty had
reported he was anxious to march. A man of
serious mien, he seemed particularly so on the
morning of April 19. One of his companions,
speaking cheerily, perhaps lightly, was gently
reproved by the brave Captain, who seemed to
have a premonition of his own fate, and reminded
the other of what the day might have
in store for them. They were about to proceed
when he turned to his wife, as if to speak, but
he could only say:</p>

<p>"Take good care of the children."<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Then he turned and marched away with his
little command. It might have been seven
o'clock when he started,<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> to the lively tune of
the "White Cockade" played by his fifer,
Luther Blanchard, and his drummer, Francis
Barker.</p>

<p>When they reached the westerly part of
Concord they must have learned what the
British were doing at the home of Col. Barrett,
for they left the highway and passed into the
fields to the northward of the Barrett home,
stopping for a while a little way off to watch
the King's soldiers in their work of destruction
of the military stores. Continuing again, they
marched through the fields until they came out
into the highway at Widow Brown's Tavern,<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
which was situated across the river from
Concord village, a mile away. From there
they proceeded by way of the Back Road, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
called, to the high ground now called Punkatasset
Hill, rising about a quarter of a mile
to the westward of the North Bridge.</p>

<p>Other companies of militia and minute-men
were already assembled there, and Capt.
Davis marched his men, who now numbered
about forty, to the left of the line, a position
that had been assigned to him at the muster
a little while before.</p>

<p>From this position on Punkatasset, they
looked down upon the gently flowing Concord
River; upon the old North Bridge which
crossed just in the immediate foreground; upon
the red-coated soldiers who stood grimly on
guard at the nearer end; and beyond, up the
river to Concord village, three-quarters of a
mile away, where curling volumes of smoke
seemed to indicate the burning of American
homes.</p>

<p>In Chelmsford, twenty-three miles northwesterly
from Boston, the alarm was early
given by a mounted messenger, upon which
guns were fired and drums beat. Minute-men
met at the Alarm-post, a rock standing where
the hay-scales were placed in after years.
Captain Moses Parker's Company, and Captain
Oliver Barron's Company, marched, not in
regular order, but in squads, and came into
Concord at Meriam's Corner and on Hardy's
Hill in time for the pursuit.</p>

<p>In Dracut, twenty-five miles from Boston,
the alarm was given soon after two o'clock, by
the firing of a gun by Capt. Trull across the
Merrimac River in Tewksbury, a signal previously
agreed upon, which aroused Gen.
Varnum. Two companies marched immediately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
one under Captain Peter Coburn, and the other
under Captain Stephen Russell. They were,
however, too remote from the scene of strife to
meet the British, but continued their rapid
march to Cambridge.</p>

<p>Littleton, twenty-five miles from Boston,
was alarmed in the morning by the news of the
British march on Concord. The messenger
then hurried over Beaver Brook Bridge, and
into the towns beyond on his mission.</p>

<p>Even in Pepperell, thirty-five miles northwesterly
from Boston, the alarm went, reaching
there about 9 o'clock. Gen. Prescott gave orders
to the Pepperell and Hollis companies, to march
to Groton, there to join others of the regiment.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Roxbury, the adjoining town to Boston,
southwesterly, was naturally the first town in
that direction to know of the movement of the
British. William Dawes, the first messenger
out of Boston, as we have seen, passed through
the town on his round-about-way to Lexington,
and must have delivered his first message there
before 11 o'clock on the evening of the 18th.
There were three companies under the command
of Captain Moses Whiting, Captain
William Draper, and Captain Lemuel Child,
respectively, who took active parts in the
events of the 19th. As they marched for the
scene of strife many women and children fled to
other towns for greater safety.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>The news reached Dedham, ten miles southwesterly
from Boston, a little after 9 o'clock in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the morning. It came by way of Needham and
Dover.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Framingham, eighteen miles southwesterly
from Boston, was alarmed before 8 o'clock in
the morning. A bell was rung, and alarm guns
fired, which assembled many of the two companies
of militia and one of minute-men, who
started in about an hour. Captain <ins class="corr" title="Errata change&mdash;Original text: 'Edgell'">Edget</ins>
went on foot the entire distance, and carried his
gun. Those living in the extreme south and
west parts of the town followed on a little later.
Not long after the men had left, a report was
started that negroes were coming to massacre
them all, which seemed the more frightful to
the women and children because of the absence
of about all of the able-bodied men. For those
defenceless ones at home it was a terrible day.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Newton, seven miles westerly from Boston,
was alarmed at early dawn by a volley from
one of John Pigeon's field-guns, kept at the gun-house
in Newton Centre, near the church.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Sudbury, eighteen miles westerly from Boston,
received its first news by a messenger from
Concord, eight miles away, who reported to
Thomas Plympton, a member of the Provincial
Congress. Captain Nixon was aroused by a
messenger, who shouted:</p>

<p>"Up, up! the red-coats are up as far as
Concord."</p>

<p>Captain Nixon started off at once on horseback.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>In Worcester, forty miles westerly from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Boston, the people were alarmed before noon
by a messenger mounted on a white horse
dripping with sweat, and bloody from spurring.
Driving at full speed through the town he
shouted:</p>

<p>"To arms, to arms! the war has begun!"</p>

<p>At the church the horse fell exhausted.
Another was procured and the news still went
on. The bell rang out the alarm, cannon were
fired, and special messengers despatched to
every part of the town to summon the soldiers.
In a little while 110 men, under Captain
Timothy Bigelow were paraded on the Green,
and soon marched for Concord. They were
met on the way by the intelligence of the
British retreat. So they changed their course
towards Boston.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>It would be interesting to know the full details
of that messenger's long ride, and just
where in the westward it ended. His exhausted
horse, covered with bloody foam, falling
in the street before the church, must have been
a spectacular sight, and one that spoke loudly
of that terrific ride, perhaps the longest one of
all the messengers. And we can safely imagine
that all along his course, other messengers,
drawing their inspiration from him, rode into
the north, and into the south, bearing with
them the news that he bore; and that in turn
their words were echoed by the gun-volley, the
clanging bell and the drum-beat.</p>

<p>The reveille had now been sounded in Essex,
in Middlesex, in Norfolk, and in Worcester
Counties, and the minute-men were on their
way to the battle of April 19.</p>

THROUGH CAMBRIDGE.</a></h2>

<p>Let us now return to the King's soldiers
under the command of Lieut.-Col. Smith, whom
we left on the shore of Charles River at Lechmere
Point in Cambridge. It was one o'clock
on the morning of the 19th, before the column
was fully under way.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Lechmere Point then had but one house,
which stood on the southern slope of the hill,
on the northern side of Spring Street, between
Third and Fourth Streets, and facing to the
south.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Where the troops landed, on Second
Street, was sufficiently remote to be out of sight
and hearing, evidently the particular aim of
the commanding officer.</p>

<p>They proceeded cautiously, following an old
farm-road around the northeasterly slope of
the hill, sometimes wading in the marshes
that bordered Willis Creek, and fording that
stream, waist-deep, in the vicinity of Bullard's
Bridge.</p>

<p>Smith evidently thought that the noise of
his soldiers tramping across the bridge itself
might attract attention. His soldiers found
the ford a long one, and the waters deep.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Even thus early on the expedition was the
British Army betrayed by one of its own
soldiers, if the tradition handed down by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Mrs. Moore can be relied upon. Seventy-five
years or more ago she related to Rev. J. L.
Sibley, who has stated accordingly, that she
was then living in Cambridge, a young girl,
and that one of the soldiers was taken sick after
his landing at Lechmere Point, and accordingly
permitted by his commander to return by boat
to Boston. He did not immediately return,
however, but made his way to the solitary
farm-house where Mrs. Moore was living.
The occupants gained from him the significance
of his midnight presence, and it was considered
of sufficient importance to communicate speedily
to their fellow townsmen.</p>

<p>Bullard's Bridge crossed Willis Creek, near
the present Prospect Street, which runs from
Cambridge to Somerville.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Later on the Creek
was called Miller's River. It was then a little
tributary to the Charles River, but has long
since been filled in, and modest dwellings, and
more pretentious business establishments now
cover its upper area.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<h2><a name="LIEUT-COL_SMITHS_ADVANCE-1" id="LIEUT-COL_SMITHS_ADVANCE-1"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">LIEUT.-COL. SMITH'S ADVANCE
THROUGH SOMERVILLE.</a></h2>

<p>The invading army emerging from Willis
Creek were now in Somerville. They quickly
arrived at Piper's Tavern, then standing in
what is now Union Square. It was after two
o'clock, but the moon was shining sufficiently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
bright for some of the soldiers to read the sign
aloud, which an awakened inmate heard. Up
the present Bow Street they marched, passing
the Choate and Frost houses, continuing along
the present Somerville Avenue to Jonathan
Ireland's house, at the southwest corner of the
present School Street. None of the inhabitants
just along there seem to have been disturbed.
A few rods farther lived Samuel
Tufts on the westerly side of the road near the
present Laurel Street. He was casting bullets
in a little hut back of his dwelling, and being
assisted by his negro, but neither of them heard
the tread of soldiers in the road. But yet a
little farther along, however, at the northwest
corner of the present Central Street lived the
widow Rand. She was disturbed by the unusual
noise in the road, and came down stairs
in her night-clothes to investigate. A hog had
been killed for her the day before, and she
feared a midnight thief. Upon opening the
door she saw the soldiers, but hid behind the
rain-water hogshead until they had passed and
then hurried across the road to tell her neighbor
Tufts of the unusual sight. At first he could
not believe the story, but with his lantern's aid
saw the many foot-prints in the road, and
became convinced. Springing to his horse's
back he took a short cut bridle path to Cambridge,
there to spread the alarm.</p>

<p>Then marched the column by Samuel Kent's
house on the westerly side of the road, at the
corner of the present Garden Court. Kent did
not awake. Then by the Capen house, a little
farther on the easterly side. No one there
awakened. Then by the Hunnewell brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
on the easterly side at the turn of the road.
They were both somewhat deaf and did not
hear the military tread.</p>

<p>The next house is the home of Timothy Tufts,
on the easterly side of the road, nearly opposite
Beech Street. Mrs. Tufts heard the soldiers,
and saw from her bed the gun-barrels shining
in the moonlight. She awakened her husband
and they both looked out upon that red-coated
column, as it halted long enough for some of
the soldiers to drink at the well.</p>

THROUGH CAMBRIDGE.</a></h2>

<p>The march was again resumed a few rods
farther along the Milk Row road, then wheeling
left southwesterly into Cambridge through
what is now Beech Street, less than an eighth
of a mile in length, then wheeling right into the
Lexington and Concord road, towards the
northwest.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> They were then on what is now
known as Massachusetts Avenue.</p>

<p>Along this part of Battle Road in Cambridge,
were perhaps captured the first prisoners,
Thomas Robins and David Harrington, both
of Lexington. Robins was carrying milk to
Boston, and in company with Harrington when
they reached the vicinity of Menotomy River,
the present dividing line between Cambridge
and Arlington. They were detained, and compelled
to return to Lexington with the soldiers,
and released at the commencement of hostilities
on the Common.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<h2><a name="LIEUT-COL_SMITHS_ADVANCE-3" id="LIEUT-COL_SMITHS_ADVANCE-3"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">LIEUT.-COL. SMITH'S ADVANCE
THROUGH ARLINGTON.</a></h2>

<p>Just after crossing the Menotomy River into
Arlington they passed a house where lived the
venerable Samuel Whittemore<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> with his sons
and grandchildren. Silent as was the march
intended to be, it awoke the inmates and
preparations for the day commenced.</p>

<p>The troops soon arrived opposite to the
Black Horse Tavern, kept by Mr. Wetherby.
Thus far their march had not been heralded
other than by the flashing lights and fleet and
silent messengers. Lieut.-Col. Smith still
thought his little army unnoticed, for he rode a
little way beyond the Tavern, halted his men,
and sent back an officer with a file of men, to
surround and guard the house, while others
should search the interior for members of the
rebel congress whom he thought to be within.
His surmise was correct, to some extent, for three
members were there, just awakened by the
heavy tread, and who heard the low-voiced
commands to halt.</p>

<p>The day before, April 18, the Committee of
Safety and the Committee of Supplies, had
held a joint meeting at the Tavern, and there
were present, Col. Azor Orne, Col. Joseph
Palmer, Col. William Heath, Col. Thomas
Gardner, Richard Devens, Abraham Watson,
Capt. Benjamin White, and John Pigeon, of the
Committee of Safety, and David Cheever, Elbridge
Gerry, Col. Charles Lee, and Col.
Benjamin Lincoln, of the Committee of Supplies.
At the close of the meeting most of them, being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
near enough, had departed for their homes. It
will be remembered that Richard Devens of
Charlestown departed early enough to meet
Revere on the Charlestown shore, and acquaint
him with the movement of the ten British
officers riding up the road. It will also be
recalled that Elbridge Gerry had sent from here
a messenger to John Hancock at Lexington to
the same effect.</p>

<p>However, there were three members of the
two committees who chose to remain at the
Black Horse Tavern that night. They were
Col. Azor Orne, Elbridge Gerry, and Col.
Charles Lee.</p>

<p>It was not quite three o'clock when the
slumbers of these three men were disturbed by
the unusual noise in the road, and they went
to the windows and looked out into the moonlight
and down on the marching host and its
gleaming arms. They watched with eager
curiosity. Not for a moment did they connect
themselves individually with the movement,
but when they heard the command to halt, and
saw a file of soldiers leave the ranks for the
Tavern they were startled, and then it suddenly
occurred to them that possibly they were the
objects of those military manœuvres. They
hurried down stairs, even clad in their night-clothes
as they were, and finally sought a safe
exit at the rear. It is said that Mr. Gerry, in
his nervous haste to escape, was on the point
of opening the front door and rushing out that
way, but was prevented by the cry of the
landlord:</p>

<p>"For God's sake, don't open that door," and
who then conducted the three to the back part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of the house, and headed them for a field of
corn stubble. Elbridge Gerry stumbled and
fell, and cried out to his friend:</p>

<p>"Stop, Orne, for me, till I can get up; I have
hurt myself."</p>

<p>His position, flat on the ground, out of sight
because of the corn-stubble, suggested that it
would be a good hiding-place for all, so the
three lay prone on the ground until the King's
troops passed on. They returned to the Tavern
finally to find that the house had indeed been
searched for them, very ineffectively, for even
their personal effects including Mr. Gerry's gold
watch, left ticking under his pillow, had not been
disturbed. The search by the soldiers had not
been a very thorough one.</p>

<p>Col. Lee never recovered from the ill effect
of his exposure on the damp ground in the night
air, too thinly clad as he was, for he died within
a month.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The march of the British forces under Lieut.
Col. Smith up to this point, was a little over five
miles, and it was nearly three o'clock. He
continued serenely for a little farther, for unknown
to him the inmates of many houses that
he passed were aroused by the measured tread
of his men.</p>

<p>Solomon Bowman, Lieutenant in Captain
Benjamin Locke's Company of Minute-men,
lived in Menotomy, now Arlington.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> He came
to the door to witness the unusual sight. A
soldier perceiving him, left the ranks and asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
for a drink of water. Bowman refused the
request, but asked him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What are you out at this time of night for?"</p>

<p>The reply of the thirsty soldier was not recorded,
but whatever it was Bowman readily
drew his own conclusions, and when the column
disappeared up the road, hastened to call out
members of his company. They formed at
day-break on the Common.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>But at the house across the road, with its
chimneys painted white, the reception was more
gracious. A tory lived there, and white chimneys,
it has been said, indicated the owner's
politics.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>The column halted again, briefly in the
centre of the town, and Lieut.-Col. Smith
despatched forward six companies of light
infantry under Major Pitcairn, for the purpose
of earlier securing the two bridges on the roads
just beyond Concord village.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Scarcely had he
done so, when signal guns and alarm bells were
heard, which indicated a general awakening to
arms of the Provincials. Smith realized the
full meaning of those ominous sounds, and from
there, in Arlington village, promptly sent back
to Gen. Gage for reinforcements. Fortunate
for him that he did so, for otherwise the day's
climax for his force would have been even more
disastrous than it was.</p>

<p>His marching soldiers could now hardly
expect to pass any house unseen. A party of
young men, playing cards, even at that late
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
hour, in an old shop that stood near the road,
lost their interest in the game and gave it up.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>At the Tufts Tavern, still standing on the
easterly side of Massachusetts Avenue, nearly
opposite Mt. Vernon Street, the soldiers halted
and some of them proceeded towards Mr.
Tufts's barn. He was awake, and saw them,
and suspected that their mission might be the
confiscation of his favorite white horse. He
called for his gun, but his prudent wife informed
him that it had been loaned. Opening the door
however, he addressed a British officer saying:</p>

<p>"You are taking an early ride, sir!"</p>

<p>"You had better go to bed and get your sleep
while you can," replied the officer significantly.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>At the corner of the main road and the one
leading to Winchester, now Forest Street, "At
the Foot of the Rocks," lived a shoemaker. A
light glimmering through the shutters caught
the attention of an officer, who sent a soldier to
investigate its cause, so late in the night. The
good wife replied that her "old man" was sick
and she was "making some herb tea." That
excuse satisfied the officer, for the family was
left undisturbed. The "tea" was in fact melted
pewter plates being run into bullets. When the
rap first came at the door the old man took to
his bed, and his wife emptied the molten pewter
into the ashes, where it was readily found after
the soldiers had passed on.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> It is probable that
ere night some of the leaden tea had hardened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
into leaden fruit, and was used for other than
medicinal purposes.</p>

<p>In the next house, still standing (1912) and
numbered 1193 Massachusetts Avenue, lived
Capt. Benjamin Locke. He looked out and
saw the marching red-coats, and knew what
their mission was. He lost no time in arousing
such of his command as lived in that neighborhood.</p>

<p>The British continued along the main road,
which at that time ran up the hill westerly
from Capt. Locke's home, and is now called
Appleton Street, into Paul Revere Road, and
out again into the present Massachusetts
Avenue. At that time there was no highway
between the extreme ends of these two.</p>

<p>Through the rest of Arlington the march was
uneventful, save the capture of the scouts
sent out from Lexington, who were so neatly
ambushed and taken. As we have seen, they
were permitted to come down the road passing
a few soldiers who were out in advance, and
who secreted themselves when an approaching
horseman was heard. After the unfortunate
scout had passed into the stretch of road
bounded by the advance guard and the main
body he was not permitted to return to Lexington.</p>

<p>Two men from Woburn, Asahel Porter and
Josiah Richardson, were thus captured. It has
been stated that they were on their way to the
Boston market. If they lived in that part of
Woburn which adjoins Lexington, then their
natural journey would have been into Lexington,
and thence through Arlington and Cambridge.
But it may be that they were scouting simply,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
for they were on horseback, and therefore without
any apparent market business. They were
compelled to dismount, their horses taken,
and then forced to walk along as prisoners.
Reaching the Common in Lexington they were
both released by their kindly disposed guard,
with the particular understanding that they were
to walk, not run, away. Richardson accepted
those conditions, carried them out and so
escaped. But Porter, once over Rufus Merriam's
garden-wall, twenty rods away from his
captors, started into a run. Some other soldier
than his guard saw him, and evidently thinking
that a prisoner was escaping, promptly shot him
through the body. Those captures were probably
made in Arlington, and not far from the
Lexington boundary line.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<h2><a name="LIEUT-COL_SMITHS_ADVANCE-4" id="LIEUT-COL_SMITHS_ADVANCE-4"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">LIEUT.-COL. SMITH'S ADVANCE
THROUGH LEXINGTON.</a></h2>

<p>It must have been just over the line into
Lexington that the young man, Simon Winship,
was met. He was on horseback, unarmed, and
passing along in a peaceable manner, when he
was halted and ordered to dismount. He
questioned their right to treat him in that
manner, but for answer they forced him from
his horse and compelled him to march on foot in
their midst. They asked him if he had been
out warning the minute-men, to which he
replied that he had not, but that he was returning
home to his father's. He was kept as a
prisoner until they arrived at Lexington Common,
two and one-half miles, where he was
compelled to witness the shooting of his fellow
townsmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Half a mile farther along, and about two miles
from Lexington Common, Benjamin Wellington,
one of Capt. Parker's Company of minute-men,
was captured. This took place very nearly at
the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Pleasant
Street. Wellington was armed and on his
way from home on Pleasant Street to join his
company. Thus it is claimed, and rightly, that
he was the first belligerent or armed man captured
by the British. But for some reason he
was allowed to depart, not towards the Common,
but for home. His gun was not returned to
him, however. He started towards home but
when out of their sight, turned and passed
northerly along the crest of the hills, parallel to
the highway, and reached the Common just
after Thaddeus Bowman, but ahead of the
British.</p>

<p>The six companies of light infantry under
command of Major Pitcairn were now considerably
in advance of the main body under Smith,
and up the road somewhat farther than the
present high school building, even farther along
than where the Woburn road, now Woburn
Street, turns off to the eastward. When still
nearer Lexington Common, within about one
hundred rods of it, they heard the beating of a
drum by William Dimond, drummer in Captain
Parker's Company. It was the summons for
that little band to assemble across the pathway
of an invading army. Major Pitcairn accepted
it as a challenge, and promptly ordered his
soldiers to halt and load their muskets,<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> and

<p>Captain John Parker's company numbered,
all told, one hundred and twenty men, but
only a few more than half answered to this call
at day-break, April 19. It will be remembered
that Paul Revere did not reach Lexington with
his message of alarm until midnight. Many
of the minute-men lived too remote to be so
quickly summoned. Captain Parker's home
was over two miles away, in the southwesterly
part of the town, near the Waltham line. He
was called at about one o'clock,<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> and stood
on the Common before two o'clock with such
of his men as had then assembled. We have
seen how they answered the roll-call and then
dispersed to be within call of the drum, as the
night was chilly. Those who lived near, went
home, and those who lived too far away, to
quickly go and come, repaired to Buckman's
Tavern, close at hand.</p>

<p>Captain Parker has been described by his
grandson, Theodore Parker, the celebrated
Unitarian preacher, as being "a great, tall man,
with a large head, and a high, wide brow."
His great grand-daughter, Elizabeth S. Parker,
has described him as stout, large-framed,
medium height, like Rev. Theodore Parker,
but with a longer face.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> We can imagine him
as a prudent man, with a quiet, yet firm courage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Two men from Woburn had just arrived, and
it was then a little before five o'clock. They
were Sylvanus Wood and Robert Douglass.
They had come about three miles, having heard,
about an hour before, the ringing of the bell in
the Old Belfry, which stood near the church on
the Common. As Wood came up he approached
Captain Parker and inquired the news. Parker
replied that he did not know what to believe,
for, half an hour before, a messenger had returned
with the assurance that no British were
on the way. While talking, another messenger,
Thaddeus Bowman, rode up with the startling
announcement that the British were within
half a mile. They were nearer than that&mdash;not
even down the road as far as Woburn Street.</p>

<p>Captain Parker then ordered his drummer,
William Dimond<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> to beat to arms. The
minute-men assembled from their homes and
from the Buckman Tavern. They were but
few, so few indeed, that he turned to Wood
and begged him to join their ranks. Wood
consented. Parker asked him if his young companion,
meaning Robert Douglass, would also
join. And Douglass also enlisted into Captain
Parker's Company. These two were indeed
brave, for the danger was really then and there.</p>

<p>The minute-men gathered around their captain
in the middle of the road, about half way
between the meeting-house and the tavern.
The meeting-house then stood where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
heroic statue of a minute-man in bronze now
stands. The tavern is still standing (1912).</p>

<p>Parker then said:</p>

<p>"Every man of you who is equipped, follow
me; and those of you who are not equipped, go
into the meeting-house and furnish yourselves
from the magazine, and immediately join the
company."<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Joseph Comee, Caleb Harrington
and Joshua Simonds then went into the meeting-house,
to comply with the Captain's command.</p>

<p>Then Parker led those who were equipped,
to the northerly end of the Common, where
they formed in single line. Sylvanus Wood
stepped from the ranks long enough to count
them, and has left his sworn statement that
there were thirty-eight, "and no more."<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>In the brief moments which followed others
were hastening to join the ranks, and as they
arrived Orderly Sergeant William Munroe
attempted to form them into a second line, and
partially succeeded.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Even later still a few
more reached the Common, and were back to
the British as they wheeled grandly around
the easterly end of the meeting-house and at
last stood on Lexington Common.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Captain
Parker's entire force then numbered between
sixty and seventy men,<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> ununiformed, scantily
armed, poorly disciplined, pitifully few as compared
with the three or four hundred of the
British.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>It is no wonder that one minute-man exclaimed:</p>

<p>"There are so few of us it is folly to stand
here."</p>

<p>Captain Parker heard the remark, and
answered:</p>

<p>"The first man who offers to run shall be shot
down."<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>On came the British, almost on the run,<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
the light companies of the Tenth Regiment in
advance.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> At their head rode Major John
Pitcairn and two other mounted officers.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>"Stand your ground," exclaimed Parker;
"don't fire unless fired upon. But if they want
to have a war let it begin here!"<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>Major Pitcairn galloped up to within six
rods of Captain Parker's foremost line, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Lay down your arms, you damned rebels,
and disperse."</p>

<p>Captain Parker, seeing the utter hopelessness
of armed resistance, gave the order to disperse
and not to fire.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> He did not, however, order
his men to lay down their arms. Evidently
Pitcairn wished to disarm them, for while they
were dispersing he shouted again:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Damn you, why don't you lay down your
arms?"<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>But no answer came back, and each one of
Capt. Parker's little band retiring from the field,
carried his gun with him.</p>

<p>Then one of the other mounted officers, about
two rods behind Pitcairn, name unknown,
brandished his sword and the regulars huzzaed
in unison. He then pointed his pistol towards
the minute-men and fired.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>Pitcairn was back to that officer, so did not
see him fire. He heard the discharge, and
easily might have mistaken it as coming from
an enemy, for he had not authorized it himself.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
Furious with passion he gave the order:</p>

<p>"Fire!"</p>

<p>There was hesitation to obey from his men,
for he repeated:</p>

<p>"Fire, damn you, fire!"<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>The first platoon of eight or nine men then
fired, evidently over the heads of the minute-men,
for none were killed or wounded.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
Pitcairn saw the effects of that volley and
realized that his men did not aim to kill. Then
came his next order:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"G&mdash;&mdash;d d&mdash;&mdash;n you, fire <em>at</em> them!"<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>The second volley surely was fired to kill.</p>

<p>John Munroe, one of the minute-men in line,
thought that the first volley was nothing but
powder and so remarked to Ebenezer Munroe,
who stood next to him. But as the second
volley came quickly and with fatal effect, the
latter answered that something more than
powder was being used for he had received a
wound in his arm, and, he added:</p>

<p>"I'll give them the guts of my gun."<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>These two Munroes then deliberately fired
at the British, though the smoke from the
latter's guns prevented a deliberate and careful
aim.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> John Munroe, after retreating about
ten rods, loaded a second time, with two balls,
and fired, but the charge was too heavy, and
he lost about a foot from the muzzle end of his
gun.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>Jonas Parker, cousin to the Captain, was
mortally wounded through the body,<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> from
the second volley, but having sufficient strength,
fired in return. He had but just uttered his
determination not to run, and had placed his
hat on the ground at his feet, and in it put his
bullets and extra flints. The British bullet in
his body caused him to sink to his knees, but he
heroically endeavored to reload. He could not,
before the advancing enemy were upon him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and one of them ended his sufferings with a
bayonet thrust.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Jonathan Harrington, Jr., was mortally
wounded, but staggered towards his home, on
the northerly end of the Common. He fell
before reaching there, struggled to his feet again,
and staggered almost to his own door, where
he expired, just as his wife rushed to meet him.
He fell near the barn, then standing in what is
now Bedford Street.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>Ensign Robert Munroe was killed while
attempting to escape. He was just at the
edge of the Common, by the wall at Merriam's
barn.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> His daughter, Anna, wife of Daniel
Harrington, who lived at the northerly end of
the Common, must have seen the tragedy, as
must also his two sons, Ebenezer and John,
and his two sons-in-law, Daniel Harrington and
Lieut. Tidd, all four in line with Captain
Parker.</p>

<p>When Parker directed such of his force as
were without ammunition to proceed into the
meeting-house near by, and supply themselves
from the town's stock, as we have written,
Joseph Comee, Caleb Harrington and Joshua
Simonds entered the sacred edifice for that
purpose. Simonds succeeded in getting down
from the upper loft to the first balcony, two
quarter casks of powder, and had removed the
head from one.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> The opening volley, but a
few rods away, indicated to him that hostilities
had commenced. He expected to meet his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
fate. Pointing his gun to the open cask he
resolved to blow up the meeting-house, himself
and his enemies, rather than to have them
enter and capture him.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Comee and Harrington
attempted to escape, and were running
from the westerly end of the meeting-house,
when the <ins class="corr" title="Errata change&mdash;Original text: 'former'">latter</ins> was shot and instantly killed,<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
and the <ins class="corr" title="Errata change&mdash;Original text: 'latter'">former</ins> wounded in the arm. He made
his way to the Marrett Munroe house, passed
through it and out of the back door, and escaped
over the hill at the rear.</p>

<p>Then with savage ferocity the British rushed
on, hunting down the fleeing minute-men, as
they attempted to escape in all directions.
A mounted officer, supposed to be Pitcairn,
pursued William Tidd up the North road (now
Hancock Street), about thirty rods, calling out
to him:</p>

<p>"Damn you, stop, or you are a dead man!"</p>

<p>Thereupon Tidd leaped over a pair of bars,
made a stand and discharged his gun at his
pursuer, who then retreated to the main body.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>Solomon Brown was not idle. Though not
in line with Captain Parker's men, he was an
active participant. After their second volley,
he opened fire from the back door of Buckman's
Tavern, and then in order to get a better
shot, passed through to the front door, and
fired from there. The British retaliated with
a return volley, and the bullet holes in the old
building still vouch for it. John Buckman,
the landlord, remonstrated with Brown, against
having his house used as a fort, so the latter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
took a new position, lying down behind a
neighboring stone wall back of the barn, and
opened fire again.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> The British again responded.
Their leaden bullets spattered against
the wall and from their impact little clouds of
stone dust like smoke, told a witness where
they struck.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Brown's aim was at an officer,
and group of soldiers, and subsequently Abijah
Harrington saw a pool of blood on the ground
where they stood.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>John Brown and Samuel Hadley were killed
on the edge of the swamp, a little way to the
north of the Common. They were retreating,
but not beyond the reach of their pursuers'
bullets.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Asahel Porter, unarmed, non-combatant, and
who had been brought up from Menotomy with
Josiah Richardson as prisoners, was killed a few
rods over the wall in Buckman's garden, to the
eastward of the Tavern. He had been liberated
with other prisoners, and had been cautioned
not to <em>run</em>, but walk away. After walking a
little distance he felt impelled to run, and was
pursued by a British bullet, with fatal effect.
Richardson walked away, and safely escaped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The work of the British on Lexington Common,
occupying less than half an hour, was
now finished. Their casualties were slight, one
man of the Tenth Regiment wounded in the
thigh, another in the hand, and Major Pitcairn's
horse shot in two places.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The killing
of the minute-men, had, however, wrought the
rank and file up to a frenzied pitch of excitement,
so much so, that the officers had difficulty
in forming them into line again.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> They
succeeded though. In the meantime the main
body under Lieut.-Col. Smith arrived, and
when they were all in marching order a volley
was fired, and huzzas shouted as an expression
of victory, and then they proceeded on their
way.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Just then the sun rose on this new field
of battle.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>Again the fife and drum, at first harsh and
loud, echoing against the neighboring hills;
then fainter and fainter, as the troops marched
up and over the summit of Concord Hill, a mile
away.</p>

<p>And when they were indeed gone, the men
and women and children of Lexington came
forth from their hiding places and looked upon
the scene. We of today, have never seen our
Common as they saw it, its turf torn with
horses' hoofs, and clotted here and there with
human blood; with prostrate figures of men,
some with faces upward to the sky, others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
with theirs smothered helplessly in the dust.
One might almost think they were asleep.</p>

<p>Such was the fulfilment of their solemn
pledge, that they stood ready to sacrifice
"<em>everything dear in life, yea and life itself, in
support of the common cause</em>."<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>Strong and willing arms then bore all of
those precious dead into the house of God.
And we can imagine, as they came forth, that
their faces were turned towards Concord Hill,
shining with a patriot's full meaning. We can
go with them through the day, as they join the
men of Acton; of Concord;&mdash;men from all
over Middlesex, and Essex, and Norfolk Counties,
who also stood so ready to defend the
common cause, yea, even with life itself!</p>

<p>The dead on or near Lexington Common were
Jonas Parker, Jonathan Harrington, Jr., Ensign
Robert Munroe, Isaac Muzzy, John Brown,
Samuel Hadley, Caleb Harrington, and Asahel
Porter. The wounded were John Robbins, so
that he could not write his name or even make
his mark;<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> Solomon Pierce; John Tidd, sabre
cut on his head by a British officer;<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Joseph
Comee, on his arm;<a name="FNanchor_149a" id="FNanchor_149a"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Ebenezer Munroe, Jr., on
his arm;<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Thomas Winship; Nathaniel Farmer;
Prince Estabrook (colored) and Jedediah Munroe
(who was killed later in the day).</p>

<p>Hardly had the soldiers of King George
reached the summit of Concord Hill, a mile
away, ere stragglers, wearing the same uniform,
were seen coming up the road, apparently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
without fear or guile. There were five in all,
but as they came singly or in twos, were not
looked upon as dangerous belligerents. Joshua
Simonds emerging from the meeting-house,
captured the first one, took his gun away, and
gave it to Captain Parker.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Deacon Benjamin
Brown captured one.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Joshua Reed, of Woburn,
captured one, took away his gun and
other warlike equipments and turned him over
to James Reed of Burlington,<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> then called
Woburn Precinct. Two more were taken on
or near the Common, and their arms, or those
of two Britons at all events, carried into Buckman
Tavern by Ebenezer Munroe, later given
to minute-men, who had none of their own.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>Another prisoner, the sixth, was captured by
Sylvanus Wood of Woburn, the man who
joined Captain Parker's Company, and stood
in line to receive the first volley, as the British
marched into sight. When they marched away
he followed on, up over Concord and Fiske Hills.
Arriving at a turn in the road, beyond the latter,
he came unexpectedly upon a soldier who for
some good reason had dropped out of the ranks.
He was seated at the roadside, and his gun
leaned at rest beyond his reach. Wood was a
little man, about five feet tall, but large in
valor. So he demanded the surrender of his
enemy. Helpless as he was he could only
comply, and Wood marched him back to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Lexington Common and placed him in the
charge of a Mr. Welsh.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>This prisoner also was captured in Lexington,
at the bluff near the Bull Tavern, later
kept by Mr. Viles. It stood not far from the
Lincoln line. He and four of the others taken
on Lexington Common were escorted to James
Reed's in Burlington by Thomas R. Willard,
William Munroe, and E. Welsh.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<h2><a name="LIEUT-COL_SMITHS_ADVANCE-5" id="LIEUT-COL_SMITHS_ADVANCE-5"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">LIEUT.-COL. SMITH'S ADVANCE
THROUGH LINCOLN.</a></h2>

<p>The march of the British from Lexington
Common to the Lincoln line and thence through
the Town of Lincoln and into Concord to
Meriam's Corner, a distance of a little over
five miles, was without unusual incidents.
That part of Lincoln through which they passed
is the edge of the town, and then, as now, but
sparsely settled. The village of Lincoln is considerably
to the westward, fortunately, and
thus most of the inhabitants were too remote
for insult or more serious trouble. The men of
Lincoln, however, were not unmindful of the
enemy's movements, as we shall see later on.
In the woods that bordered the highway, the
British saw some of them,<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> but not in sufficient
number evidently to oppose their advance.</p>

<h2><a name="LIEUT-COL_SMITHS_ADVANCE-6" id="LIEUT-COL_SMITHS_ADVANCE-6"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">LIEUT.-COL. SMITH'S ADVANCE
INTO CONCORD.</a></h2>

<p>From Meriam's Corner in Concord to the
centre of Concord village is about a mile and a
quarter. From the Corner and on the northerly
side of the road, commences a line of hills
rising fully sixty feet,<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> or more above the road,
which skirts along their edges, and perhaps an
eighth of mile from, and parallel to, their summits.
The ridge commands very easily
and nicely the road, for the entire distance,
and was looked upon by both sides as a desirable
place to occupy. Captain Nathan Barrett and
his company of Concord militia had occupied
that part of it near the meeting-house from
about an hour after sunrise, for they had received
the intelligence of the killing of six
Americans at Lexington.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Capt. George Minot
and his company of minute-men, assembled
there also.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Farther along the ridge, towards
Meriam's Corner, other Americans had taken
position,<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> probably as individuals. It was
about two hours after sunrise when the enemy
came into sight.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>As Lieut.-Col. Smith came into view of this
location he saw the body of provincials along
the ridge, and quickly decided to dislodge them.
The light infantry were ordered to that work,
and they succeeded in forcing the Americans
back to the village. The grenadiers continued
along the road, driving before them there,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Captain David Brown's Company of Concord
minute-men, who had marched up from the
village as far as Meriam's Corner, on a scouting
trip. When the British were seen descending
from the hills of Lincoln, they halted, and when
the enemy came within about one hundred rods,
wheeled about and marched back to the village,
the fifes and drums of both forces playing.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>On the hill not far from the village stood the
Liberty Pole, from the summit of which some
kind of a flag was flying. The British cut it
down.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>It was between seven and eight o'clock, when
the enemy reached Concord village.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> The
march from Lexington must have been a steady
one, without interruption. The distance is
about six and a quarter miles and the elapsed
time about two hours. The entire distance
from Lechmere Point is about seventeen miles,
sufficiently long, even thus far, to weary many
of the soldiers. Add to the length of the
march, their loss of sleep, before starting, and
the excitement on Lexington Common, it is
easy to imagine that a few halts for rest were
allowed, though an anxiety to accomplish their
errand would not have permitted of unnecessary
delays.</p>

<p>Their advance into Concord village compelled
the Americans to move along to an adjoining
hill just to the northward, which they subsequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
abandoned, and marched still farther
along, passing over the North Bridge and
taking a stronger position on Punkatasset Hill
whose summit is fully two hundred feet<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
higher than Concord River, and perhaps half a
mile from the bridge, and rather more than a
mile from the village itself. It was their third
position, and then about eight o'clock in the
morning.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>Reaching Concord village Lieut.-Col. Smith
proceeded at once to carry out the plan of his
expedition, viz., the destruction of the military
stores. Ensign De Bernicre acted as guide to
where they could be found, for he had been one
of the spies sent out by Gen. Gage for the
express purpose of locating them.</p>

<p>Smith found but few people in the village, for
the able-bodied men were with their companies,
and many of the non-combatants had considered
other places more secure. Some, however,
remained, and the British officers labored to
convince them that no bodily harm was
intended.</p>

<p>Pitcairn was especially active in that diplomatic
work, but insisting all the time that their
doors must be unlocked that the soldiers might
search their premises. Many would not submit
peaceably to such an indignity, and one of
those old men of Concord, had the courage to
strike Major John Pitcairn in the presence of
the King's soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> We can imagine this
incident happened before that doughty officer
entered Wright's Tavern, and called for liquor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
into which he plunged his finger to stir the
sweetening. Some of the precious fluid slopped
over, which he likened to the way Yankee
blood should spill ere nightfall, a remark
possibly inspired by his over-wrought feelings
at the affront.</p>

<p>Captain Lawrence Parsons of the Tenth Regiment,
with six light companies, was immediately
despatched for the North Bridge, distance three
quarters of a mile. There he left Capt. Walter
Sloane Lawrie of the Forty-third Regiment,
with three of the companies for guard duty,
while he proceeded with the other three companies,
guided by Ensign De Bernicre over the
bridge and up the left bank of the Concord
River and its northerly branch, the Assabet
River, to the home of Colonel Barrett,<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> almost
two miles from the bridge.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Capt. Lawrie, arriving near the bridge,
assigned one company of the Forty-third Regiment
to the bridge itself, one of the Tenth
Regiment, to a nearby hill, and one of the
Fourth or King's Own Regiment to another
hill a quarter of a mile farther away,<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> so
arranged as to be within supporting distance of
each other.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>After the six companies under Parsons had
departed Lieut.-Col. Smith sent Capt. Mundy
Pole of the Tenth Regiment with a force,
towards the South Bridge, incidentally for
guard duty there, and in particular to destroy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
such military stores as they might find.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> The
distance from the village to the bridge is almost
a mile.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> They went a little beyond, to the
homes of Amos and Ephraim Wood, and in the
vicinity of Lee's Hill.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>Within the village the British were very
active in their search for the military supplies.
Public buildings, stores, and private dwellings
were alike examined. At the malt house of
Ebenezer Hubbard a considerable quantity of
flour was discovered, and the end boards of the
building were pulled off, that the barrels might
the easier and faster be rolled out into the
road, where they were broken open, and the
contents mixed with the dust.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> At the store
house of Timothy Wheeler, another lot of flour
was found, which the miller, by a little artifice,
saved. It was indeed public property, but
Wheeler, placing his hand upon the bags of
meal, one after another, and which stood with
the flour, assured the soldiers that he was a
miller, and that they were his.</p>

<p>They were considerate enough to spare his
personal property, and included the flour.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>At the neighboring grist-mill several barrels
were seized, and rolled to or into the mill pond,
but part was subsequently saved, as it hardly
reached the water.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Deacon Thomas Barrett, brother of Colonel
Barrett, was a resident of the village. He was
an aged man, and remained quietly in or near
his home while the soldiers were busy in looting
and destroying. He was a man of gentle
demeanor, and unarmed, but they seized him,
called him rebel, and even threatened to take
his life. He pleaded with them to dispense with
that trouble, for his extreme age meant that he
should soon die anyway. They permitted him
to go in peace. In his building was a gun-factory
carried on by his son, Samuel Barrett.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>In the meantime large numbers of Americans
were gathering on the hills to the northward
beyond the river. The commander of the
British at the North Bridge and vicinity was not
unmindful of that, and deemed it wise to concentrate
his little army of three companies at
the bridge itself, as that seemed to be the
threatened point of attack. Consequently the
two remoter companies were marched down
from the hills and joined the third, and then all
three marched to the easterly or nearer end of
the bridge.</p>

<p>About a quarter of a mile beyond the North
Bridge, and in a westerly direction from it, is
a little hill about forty feet higher than the
river.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> To reach it by road from the bridge
meant traveling over two sides of an irregular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
triangle, and going nearly half a mile.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> The
crest of the elevation commands a beautiful
view up and down the river, with the North
Bridge in the middle foreground, and the
village nearly a mile away to the southward.</p>

<p>The Americans moved forward from Punkatasset
Hill to this, their fourth position, at about
nine o'clock, as their reinforcements had augmented
sufficiently to induce a growing feeling
of aggressiveness. Here were assembling the
sturdy men of Concord and of Acton; of Bedford,
Lincoln, and Carlisle, and of other neighboring
towns. Joseph Hosmer acted as Adjutant,
forming the soldiers as they arrived, the minute
companies on the right and the militia on the
left, facing the bridge.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>Col. James Barrett summoned his subordinate
officers for a council of war, the first one of
the American Revolution, and while they were
so engaged, Captain Isaac Davis and his
company of minute-men from Acton arrived,
and marched to a position on the left of the line,
as they had been accustomed to on training-days.
After halting his little command, Capt.
Davis joined his brother officers in their council
of war.</p>

<p>There were then assembled on that little hill,
four Concord companies, commanded respectively
by Capt. David Brown, fifty-two men;
Capt. Charles Miles, fifty-two men; Capt.
George Minot, number of men unknown; and
Capt. Nathan Barrett, number of men also
unknown. From Acton there were three companies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
one under Capt. Isaac Davis, thirty-eight
men; one under Capt. Joseph Robins,
number of men unknown; and one under Capt.
Simon Hunt,<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> number of men also unknown.
There were two companies from Bedford, one
being under Capt. John Moore, fifty-one men;
and the other under Capt. Jonathan Willson,
twenty-eight men. A little later Captain Willson
was killed and his command fell to Lieut.
Moses Abbott. Lincoln was represented by
Capt. William Smith with sixty-two men.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>In addition to these regular organized soldiers,
there were many individuals present,
who undoubtedly took a patriotic part in the
subsequent events, and easily constituted the
American force as one of at least four hundred
and ninety.</p>

<p>These men looked down on the hostile troops
at the Bridge, and beyond the river to the
village, where huge volumes of smoke were
rising from the bonfires of military stores.
These seemed to them as the burning of their
homes. Inspired by that fear, and by their
knowledge of the bloodshed at Lexington, they
were ready to follow where their officers should
lead. Their council could only decide in one
way:</p>

<p>"<em>To march into the middle of the town for its
defence, or die in the attempt.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>Col. Barrett then gave the order to Major
John Buttrick to lead an advance over the
Bridge and to the centre of the town. And his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
instructions were like those of Captain Parker
a few hours before, not to fire unless fired upon.</p>

<p>It was then between nine and ten o'clock.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
Col. Barrett retired to the rear on higher
ground,<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> and Major Buttrick hastened to
execute his order. His choice for a company
to lead was naturally one from Concord, but
the Captain of that one replied that he would
rather not.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> We wonder at the reason, for
Concord seemed to be the most deeply concerned
just at that hour. However, it could
not have been for lack of courage, for the
Concord companies were a part of that advance.
Then Buttrick turned to Capt. Davis, and
asked him if he was afraid to go. Davis
promptly responded:</p>

<p>"No, I am not; and there isn't a man in my
company that is."<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>He immediately gave the command to
march, and the men of Acton wheeled from the
left of the line to the right, and were the first to
march upon the invaders.</p>

<p>Major John Buttrick of Concord led in person
this little army down the slope towards the
river, but not until he had offered the command
to a superior officer who happened to be present,
but without a command, Lieut.-Col. John
Robinson of Prescott's Regiment. Robinson
lived in Westford, and had responded to the
alarm. Magnanimously he refused the honor
to lead, but with characteristic bravery, begged
that he might march by Buttrick's side, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the latter acceded to. These were the two men
in front of all the American host to first march
against the soldiers of their King.</p>

<p>Then came Captain Isaac Davis and his
company of thirty-seven men from Acton.
Then next, a Concord company under Charles
Miles. Then two more Concord companies
under Capt. David Brown and Capt. Nathan
Barrett.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Another company from Acton, then
fell into line, the one commanded by Capt.
Simon Hunt. They were just turning the
corner of the main road when the firing at
the bridge took place.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> By order of Col.
Barrett the companies from Bedford and
Lincoln next fell into line. The march was by
twos, and to the tune of "The White Cockade,"
played by two young fifers, Luther Blanchard
of Davis's Acton company, and John Buttrick
of Brown's Concord company.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>Down the road, now discontinued, in a
southerly direction to the point of the triangle,
then back towards the Bridge in an easterly
direction, in all about a quarter of a mile, they
marched.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> The British watched the advance
keenly, and when the southerly point of the
triangle was reached, and the columns wheeled
left towards the Bridge, they commenced to
pull up the planks. Major Buttrick, in a loud
voice, ordered them to desist, whereupon they
left the Bridge and hastily formed for action in
the road just beyond the easterly end. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
came the report of the first hostile gun in the
battle of Concord, fired from the British ranks.
Solomon Smith,<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> a member of Davis's Acton
company, saw where the ball struck the river,
on his right, which then ran nearly parallel to
the road. This was quickly followed by two
others, but they were not thought by the
Americans to be aimed at them either.</p>

<p>Still onward marched Major Buttrick and his
little band. They soon came nearly to the
Bridge, when a sudden volley from the British
indicated their serious intention to check the
American advance. Luther Blanchard, the
fifer from Acton, was slightly wounded.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>Major Buttrick heard his cry of anguish, and
almost jumping into the air, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Fire, for God's sake, fire!"</p>

<p>The order was obeyed. The British responded,
killing Capt. Davis and one of his
privates, Abner Hosmer. Davis on realizing
that Blanchard was wounded had taken a
firmer position on a flat stepping-stone, and
while aiming his gun received a bullet through
his heart. Hosmer was killed by a bullet
through his head.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Ezekiel Davis, brother of
the Captain, and a private in his company,
was wounded, as was also Joshua Brooks of
Lincoln, whose forehead was slightly cut by a
bullet which continued through his hat.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>The opening volley of the Americans was
also effective, killing one private, and wounding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Lieut. Hull of the Forty-third Regiment; Lieut.
Gould of the Fourth; Lieut. Kelly of the Tenth;
Lieut. Sutherland of the Thirty-eighth; and a
number of the rank and file.</p>

<p>The Americans under Major Buttrick advanced
and the three British companies, under
Lowrie, gave way, and retreated towards
Concord village. They were met on the way by
reinforcements consisting of two or three companies
headed by Lieut.-Col. Smith himself,
who was responding to a very urgent request
for assistance from Capt. Lowrie, sent just
before the engagement began. Smith being a
"very fat, heavy man," according to the testimony
of one of his officers, who has left an
interesting diary for our perusal,<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> instead of
reaching Lowrie at the Bridge met him but a
little way out of the village.</p>

<p>From the moment of that heroic advance of
the Americans over the bridge, military discipline
among them ceased.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> They rushed after
the retreating British but a few rods, then proceeded
to an eminence on the east side of the
road back of Elisha Jones's house, taking
position there behind a stone wall, and perhaps
an eighth of a mile from where the British halted
when they were met by their reinforcements.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Why the Americans turned aside instead of
pursuing their enemies into Concord village as
they had resolved to do, can only be surmised.
Why they gave no heed to the small force still
behind them up the river, engaged in destroying
American property at Col. Barrett's, excites our
wonder, too. Not lack of personal courage
surely, but rather a lack of military experience.</p>

<p>While these scenes were being enacted at the
North Bridge, the British force above alluded
to, and consisting of three companies under
Capt. Parsons, had gone up the river, to the
home of Col. Barrett, nearly two miles from the
Bridge. They were under the direct guidance
of the spy, Ensign De Bernicre, who had previously
gone over the road, and made himself
familiar with its topography, and particularly
with the hiding of military stores among the
homes along the way. He knew thoroughly
well of those at Col. Barrett's, and that place
above all others was the principal objective.</p>

<p>Early that morning the men in the Barrett
family had busied themselves in securing the
Colonial stores. They had plowed a tract of
land about thirty feet square, south of the old
barn and later used as a kitchen garden. One
guided a yoke of oxen, in turning over the
furrows, into which others dropped the muskets
that had been stored in the house. Succeeding
furrows covered them nicely. Musket balls
were carried to the attic, put into the bottoms
of barrels which were then filled with feathers.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
Other munitions were hidden in the adjoining
woods.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>When the soldiers reached there they found
the homestead in care of the venerable wife of
Col. Barrett. Capt. Parsons explained his
mission, and assured her it was his aim to
destroy public property only, and to capture
Col. Barrett.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> They commenced their search,
but did not find as much as expected.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Nor
did they capture the commander of the minute-men.</p>

<p>While this work was in progress, Col. Barrett's
son, Stephen, a young man of about twenty-five
years, returned from his mission, up the river
road to Price Plain, to intercept minute-men
expected from Stow, Harvard, and other towns
in that vicinity. He wished to inform them of
the danger surrounding his own home, that they
might travel by some other road into Concord.</p>

<p>Reaching the kitchen door of his own home
he was met by a British officer, who, thinking
he might be Col. Barrett, placed him under
arrest. Upon learning from Mrs. Barrett,
however, of his mistake, that he was her son,
the young man was released.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Another son,
James, Jr., being lame and inactive, did not
attract any hostile attention.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>So successfully had Col. Barrett and his
numerous assistants secreted the large amount
of provincial property left in his charge, that
Capt. Parsons found but little to confiscate or
destroy. He seized and burned a few gun-carriages
in the road near the house.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the remotest point of the British
invasion. The three companies at Col. Barrett's
had by far the longest route of any, by
several miles. After a night without sleep, and
so long a march they were hungry and thirsty,
and Mrs. Barrett was requested to supply their
wants. She was in no position to refuse.
Some, if not all, were willing to pay for what
they had, but the good lady refused, saying:</p>

<p>"We are commanded to feed our enemy if he
hunger."</p>

<p>Some, however, insisted, and on leaving
tossed their money into her lap. She could only
exclaim:</p>

<p>"It is the price of blood!"<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>The object of their mission being accomplished,
so far as within their power, they set
out for a return march to the village by the
same roundabout route over the North Bridge,
as they came. When at Widow Brown's
Tavern at the cross roads, within about a mile
of the Bridge, they halted and three or four
officers entered the house for drink. The
soldiers sat at the roadside, and drink was
carried out to them. Pay was offered to Mrs.
Brown by the officers, but she declined to
receive it. Charles Handley, a youth in his
thirteenth year, and a native of Concord, was
living there, and has left his sworn statement,
that he then heard the guns at the Bridge, but
that the British did not appear to notice them.
It was then generally understood that they
knew nothing of the engagement until their
arrival at the scene, and saw the British slain.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
There were two, one having been killed instantly,
and the other, at first wounded, and while
helpless, despatched with a savage cut in the
head with a hatchet. It seems that after the
British had been driven from the Bridge and
the Americans had also passed in pursuit, a
young man employed by Rev. William Emerson,
at the Old Manse (still standing, 1912), came
forth to view the field of strife. He saw the
wounded Briton attempting to arise, and in a
thoughtless moment, conceived it his patriotic
duty to kill him. He did so, as the soldier was
on his knees, in a futile attempt to stand. The
hatchet sank deep into his skull, and the blood
gushed forth, and covered the top of his head,
as he sank back to Concord battle ground. A
little later the British force under Capt. Parsons
passed him on their way to the village. They
could only shudder, and bear away the impression,
which was subsequently published, that
the Americans had scalped and cut off the ears
of their enemies.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> The young man who did
the deed lived many years, and often confessed
that his conscience had been sorely troubled.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>The men under Captain Parsons were thus
permitted to join the main body of British very
much to their surprise, and which was forcibly
expressed by Ensign De Bernicre in his account
of the battle.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> As we have seen, the main body
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of the Americans halted on the high ground to
the eastward of the Elisha Jones house. From
that moment to the arrival of the British at
Charlestown Neck, no one seemed to be in
command, and discipline of any kind was not
attempted.</p>

<p>While Military critics cannot endorse the
kind of warfare employed by the Americans on
that day, almost if not quite of a guerilla nature,
yet it must be confessed that their death roll
was much smaller and their success, in some
respects much greater, than it would have been
had they fought as an army, in the open, under
some brave commander. The British, on the
other hand, were ever in the highway, standing
or marching in a solid formation. The Americans
were never more than a dozen or a score,
side by side, and usually not more than two or
three. Their selected position was a sheltered
one; behind the walls; among the trees; even
within the houses. Often the vigilant flank-guard,
which Lieut.-Col. Smith counted upon so
intelligently, came upon them unawares, and so
added to the American death roll. Had they
known the value of the flanking movements, and
still fought as individuals as they did from the
North Bridge to Charlestown Neck, but few
would have been slain.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the Americans halted on
the high ground to the eastward of Elisha
Jones's house. They felt that when the retreating
British were reinforced, they would
return and renew the struggle. In their strong
position behind the stone wall they had no
cause to fear an assault, for the advantage
would be greatly with them. But Lieut.-Col.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Smith also realized as much and turned his
troops back into Concord village.</p>

<p>Several of the minute-men then returned to
the North Bridge, and conveyed the bodies of
Capt. Isaac Davis and private Abner Hosmer
to the home of Major Buttrick, which stood
near the spot from which they started on their
fatal march.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Later in the day they were conveyed
to Acton.</p>

<p>Such was the baptism of Concord soil with
the blood of its brave defenders.</p>

<p>Captain Mundy Pole of the Tenth Regiment
with one hundred men, had been detailed by
Lieut.-Col. Smith for guard duty at the South
Bridge. He was also instructed to destroy any
public stores that he might find in that vicinity.</p>

<p>The Bridge is nearly a mile southerly from
the village, and in an opposite direction from
the North Bridge, the two being nearly two
miles apart.</p>

<p>Captain Pole reached there about eight
o'clock, and promptly placed a guard at the
Bridge to prevent any one passing into or out
of the village. Then he foraged the immediate
neighborhood for food and drink for his force,
which was easily accomplished, as most of the
able bodied men were absent on patriotic duties.</p>

<p>They searched the houses of Ephraim Wood,
Joseph Hosmer and Amos Wood, but with
slight success, for most of the stores once there
had been secreted elsewhere. The Britons
demeaned themselves nicely in this neighborhood
and were generous enough to pay for what
food they took. Each of the women at Amos
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Wood's house was presented with a guinea.
In this home was one room pretty well filled
with goods that were sought for. It was locked,
but the gallant officer believing that women
were hiding within, issued orders that none of
his soldiers should enter it.</p>

<p>Capt. Mundy Pole's little expedition to this
part of Concord, was not entirely without
results, however. He succeeded in knocking off
the trunnions of three iron twenty-four pounders,
burning their carriages, destroying a small
quantity of flour, and several barrels of trenchers
and wooden spoons.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>Some of his soldiers ascended Lee's Hill, about
one hundred feet<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> higher than, and overlooking,
the river down to North Bridge. From
there they could plainly see the growing excitement,
as evidenced by the moving about of the
minute-men, and the constant accession to their
numbers. Finally there came echoing up the
valley, the signal gun, then two more, then the
volley; and they knew the scene on Lexington
Common was being re-enacted.</p>

<p>They descended the Hill, and gathered with
the others at the South Bridge, removed the
planks therefrom to protect their retreat, and
marched rapidly back to the main body in the
village.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>Lieut.-Col. Smith now commenced to realize
his distance from Boston and the dangers that
might lurk along the way. He had his entire
force assembled in Concord village very soon
after ten o'clock, but his many wounded soldiers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
required attention before he could begin his
return march. Some of them were attended
by Dr. Cumings and Dr. Minot, of the village.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
As no provision had been made by the British
commander for the transportation of his disabled
soldiers, the people of Concord were
called upon to supply the deficiency. A chaise
was confiscated from Reuben Brown, and
another from John Beaton. Bedding from
near-by houses was added for the comfort of
the riders. Several horses were taken, among
them one belonging to Capt. Smith of the
Lincoln Company, which he had, for some
reason, left at Wright Tavern, before he
marched for North Bridge. Lieut. Hayward
of Concord, recaptured Reuben Brown's chaise
from the regulars in Arlington, and with it a
horse, bedquilt, pillow, etc., for the owners of
which he advertised in the <cite>Essex Gazette</cite> of
Aug. 10, 1775.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>Besides his wounded, Lieut.-Col. Smith had
his able-bodied men to consider also. They
had been without sleep since the time of starting
from Boston Common, at half past ten o'clock
the evening before, and possibly back to the
night before that. They had already marched
over seventeen miles to Concord village, and
those who had gone to Col. Barrett's, and to
the North and South Bridges, so much farther
yet. They had passed through the exciting
scenes of bloodshed at Lexington Common and
North Bridge, which must have added agitated
minds to weary bodies. His soldiers needed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
rest and Smith knew it, and was justified in
granting the two hours that he did.</p>

<p>Aside from those reasons Smith had another
good one for not starting, at once. It will be
remembered that when he had reached Arlington
(Menotomy) realizing his march had aroused
the entire community, he had sent back an
urgent request to Gen. Gage for strong reinforcements.
He could reasonably expect them
to reach any place that he had, within three
hours at least, of his time. But unfortunately
for Smith the forces under Percy had not
started until nine o'clock that morning, and
were then less than five miles on the way, and
coming over a longer route than he had taken.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>The destruction of the public military stores,
according to the report of Lieut.-Col. Smith,
hardly balanced his loss of prestige even, to
say nothing of the British lives that had been
and would be given up in the cause. He gives
his men credit for knocking the trunnions off
from three field pieces of iron ordnance; destroying
by fire some new gun carriages, and a
great number of carriage wheels; and throwing
into the river considerable flour, some powder,
musket balls and other small articles. De
Bernicre in his account, adds to the list, by
mentioning barrels of trenchers and spoons of
wood destroyed by Capt. Pole.</p>

<p>While the bonfire was consuming the cannon
wheels, it was discovered that the Court
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
House, facing the Green, was on fire. It was
noticed by Mrs. Martha Moulton, an elderly
widow who lived close by, and who had not
fled with the younger part of the population
as the enemy approached. She felt that her
years, seventy-one, would be her protection, as
indeed they were. She has left an interesting
statement of the events of those few hours,&mdash;how
her home was invaded by the soldiers for
food and water; how Pitcairn and other officers
sat before her door, watching the soldiers in
their destructive work; how she discovered the
Court House on fire, and how earnestly she
pleaded with them to put it out, even bringing
water for them to do so. At first they were
indifferent, but finally yielded, and extinguished
the flames. Thus was the Court House saved,
and possibly some of the adjoining homes, by
Martha Moulton.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>The provincial Congress, in their published
account of the damages sustained in Concord,
aside from the public stores, set the value at
£274, 16s. 7d. of which £3, 6s. was for broken
locks in His Majesty's Jail.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<h2><a name="LIEUT-COL_SMITHS_RETREAT" id="LIEUT-COL_SMITHS_RETREAT"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">LIEUT.-COL. SMITH'S RETREAT
THROUGH CONCORD.</a></h2>

<p>It was about twelve o'clock when Lieut.-Col.
Smith gave the order to march. As the neighboring
hills were covered with provincials,<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
ordered out even larger bodies of flankers, and
farther away from the main body in the highway.
The march along the Lexington road for
a little more than a mile to Meriam's Corner,
was uneventful, but at that place the struggle
was renewed. There the men of Concord,
Acton, Lincoln, and Bedford, came within rifle
shot of the highway. They had passed along
the Great Meadow, so called, northerly from
the range of hills near the highway, and reached
Meriam's Corner at about the same time that
Smith did.</p>

<p>New American forces joined the contest here
also. Billerica sent Lieut. Crosby with twelve
men; Capt. Edward Farmer, thirty-five men;
and Capt. Jonathan Stickney, fifty-four men.
Chelmsford sent Capt. Oliver Barron, sixty-one
men, and <ins class="corr" title="Errata change&mdash;Original text: 'Lieut.'">Colonel</ins> Moses Parker's company,
forty-three men. Framingham sent Capt.
Simon <ins class="corr" title="Errata change&mdash;Original text: 'Edgett'">Edget</ins>, seventy-six men; Capt. Jesse

John Bacheller, sixty-one men; Capt. Thomas
Eaton, sixty-three men; Capt. John Flint,
seventy-nine men, and Capt. John Walton,
eighty-eight men. Some of the Reading companies,
at least, marched from home under
Major, afterwards Governor, John Brooks.
Rev. Edmund Foster accompanied Capt. Bacheller's
company, as a volunteer, and has left an
interesting narrative of what he saw. Sudbury
sent Capt. <ins class="corr" title="Errata change&mdash;Original text: 'Nathan'">Nathaniel</ins> Cudworth, forty men; Capt.
Aaron Haynes, <ins class="corr" title="Errata change&mdash;Original text: 'thirty-nine'">forty</ins> men; Capt. Isaac

and Capt. Moses Stone, <ins class="corr" title="Errata change&mdash;Original text: 'twenty-five'">thirty-five</ins> men. Woburn
sent Capt. Samuel Belknap, sixty-six men;
Capt. Jonathan Fox, seventy-two men; and
Capt. Joshua Walker, one hundred and <ins class="corr" title="Errata change&mdash;Original text: 'sixteen'">seventeen</ins>
men.</p>

<p>The American reinforcements coming in at
Meriam's Corner numbered eleven hundred
and <ins class="corr" title="Errata change&mdash;Original text: 'thirty-seven'">forty-nine</ins>, making a total of fifteen
hundred and <ins class="corr" title="Errata change&mdash;Original text: 'sixty-five'">seventy-seven</ins> enrolled men in
the ranks of the Provincials if all at the
North Bridge still remained in the fight.</p>

<p>There were many other minute-men anxious to
be in the first struggle, but who lived too far away.
Stow sent a company of militia belonging to
Col. Prescott's regiment, commanded by Capt.
William <ins class="corr" title="Errata change&mdash;Original text: 'Whitcomb'">Whitcom</ins>, numbering eighty-one men.
They did not reach North Bridge until about
noon, too late to be in the action there, but in
ample time to be active in the pursuit. We are
told that another company from Stow under
Capt. Hapgood, also joined, but I find no
returns in the Massachusetts State Archives.</p>

<p>Three companies from Westford reached the
North Bridge too late, but were active afterwards.
They were respectively under the
command of Capt. Oliver Bates, thirty-six men;
Capt. Jonathan Minot, thirty-six men; and
Capt. Joshua Parker, forty-one men.</p>

<p>As the Reading men came along the road from
Bedford, and nearing Meriam's Corner, they
discovered the flank guard of the British just
descending the ridge of hills. There were from
eighty to one hundred red-coats, and they were
marching slowly and deliberately down the hill,
without music and without words. The Americans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
were but a little over three hundred feet
away. They halted and remained in silence
watching their foes. The British flankers soon
gained the main road, at the Corner, and passed
along a few hundred feet towards Lincoln and
Lexington, over the little bridge that spans
Mill Brook. The Americans gathered around
the Meriam house. As the British passed the
bridge they wheeled suddenly and fired in
volley, but too high, so no one was struck.
Then the Americans returned the fire with
better aim, and two Britons fell on the easterly
side of the little stream, while several were
wounded, among them Ensign Lester of the
Tenth Regiment.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>Less than half a mile along that road, from
Meriam's Corner, is the northerly corner of
the town of Lincoln. Along on the edge of
Lincoln the highway continues; still in an
easterly direction, for less than another half
mile, this stretch being on rather higher
ground, the northerly side of the road in
Concord, the southerly side in Lincoln. On
the Lincoln side is the Brooks Tavern (still
standing, 1912). This little elevation is called
Hardy's Hill, and is about sixty feet higher than
Concord village.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Along the summit the skirmishing
was actively renewed, and continued
down its easterly slope into Lincoln.</p>

<p>This ended the struggle in Concord, but her
sons and the others were not mindful of the
boundary line. To them it was more than the
Battle of Concord; it was the Battle of April
Nineteenth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>The patriots who died in Concord were Capt.
Isaac Davis, and private Abner Hosmer, both
of Acton. The wounded were Luther Blanchard
and Ezekiel Davis also of Acton; Jonas
Brown of Concord and Joshua Brooks of
Lincoln. These were all at the North Bridge.
Abel Prescott, Jr., of Concord was wounded while
in the village. The British killed were two
privates at North Bridge, and two at Meriam's
Corner bridge. Their wounded were Lieut.
Gould of the Fourth Regiment, Lieut. Kelly of
the Tenth Regiment, Lieut. Sutherland of the
Thirty-eighth, and Lieut. Hull of the Forty-third,
and a number of privates; all at the
North Bridge. At the little bridge near Meriam's
Corner Ensign Lester of the Tenth
Regiment and several privates were wounded.</p>

THROUGH LINCOLN.</a></h2>

<p>At the foot of the easterly slope of Hardy's
Hill is a little stream crossing the road in a
northerly direction. It is in Lincoln, and on
most maps is put down as Mill Brook, the
same that curves around and crosses the road
near Meriam's Corner, rather more than a mile
back. At Hardy's Hill it has sometimes been
called Tanner's Brook.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>The British had now reached this point, and
were marching rapidly, keeping their flankers
out parallel to the highway.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>Over the bridge and up another slight rise
and then the road turns at a sharp angle to the
left, northeasterly, to still higher ground about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
eighty feet higher than Concord village. On
the northwesterly side of that road was a heavy
growth of trees and on the opposite side a
younger growth. On each side of the road, in
those two forest growths, many American
minute-men were posted.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> They had anticipated
the passing of the British, by hurrying
across the Great Fields, so called, from the
Bedford Road near Meriam's Corner. Among
these were the Bedford company under Capt.
Willson. This forest lined road was only about
a half of a mile in extent before it turned again
to the eastward.</p>

<p>When the foremost British reached this
location the Americans poured in a deadly
volley, that killed eight and wounded many
others.</p>

<p>The contest was by no means one-sided.
The attention of the Americans here, as all
along the line to Charlestown, was too firmly
fixed on the ranks of the enemy marching in
the road. The British flankers were unnoticed
and unthought of. Silently and rapidly they
swung along, on their parallel lines, and very
often closed in on those little tell-tale puffs of
smoke that arose behind the trees and walls,
and among the bowlders. Thus were many
Americans surprised and slain&mdash;more, probably
twice or thrice over, than were killed by the
soldiers in the highway.</p>

<p>It was at this bloody angle of Battle Road,
that Capt. Jonathan Willson of Bedford met his
death. And so did Nathaniel Wyman, a native
of Billerica, but a member of Capt. Parker's
Company. Daniel Thompson, of Woburn, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
also killed here. Another son of Bedford, Job
Lane, was severely wounded and disabled for
life.<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>The next day five of the British killed were
removed to the little cemetery, near Lincoln
village several miles away, for burial. Not
many years ago the Town of Lincoln caused to
be placed over their common grave, a neat and
appropriately lettered Memorial Stone.</p>

<p>After the northeasterly angle the road turns
again easterly towards Lexington. Half or
three quarters of a mile along are the two
Hartwell houses, still standing (1912), on the
northerly side of the road, and but a few
hundred feet apart.</p>

<p>In the westerly, or first one, lived Sergt.
John Hartwell, and in the easterly one, Sergt.
Samuel Hartwell, both members of Capt.
Smith's Lincoln Company. Both were absent
on duty then, but the wife of Samuel was at
home. She has furnished a vivid narrative of
what she saw and experienced, that afternoon
and the following morning. Her first alarm of
the coming Britons was reports of musketry,
seemingly in the vicinity of the Brooks Tavern.
Then nearer and nearer, to the bloody angle.
Then the hurrying red-coats themselves, anxious
and wild in their demeanor, as they hurried
along past her house. And how one, in his
insane anger, fired into their garret, though he
could see no foeman there.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>For another mile along the Lincoln road the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
British must have had some relief, for the
country is comparatively level, the fields extending
away smoothly on either side. It was not
a complete lull in the battle, however, for an
American bullet terminated the life of one
Briton at least. The remains were uncovered
a few years ago when the road builders were
widening and grading anew the highway. He
was re-interred over the bordering wall in the
field to the southwest of the highway, a short
distance westerly from Folly Pond.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Then comes an easterly bend in the road,
though still continuing nearly level, and for
about a quarter of a mile, to the Nelson house.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>
Here lived Josiah Nelson, the Lincoln patriot,
who, as we have written, alarmed his neighbors
in Bedford the night before. Around it were
many picturesque bowlders, large enough to
shelter venturesome minute-men. And they
were there. William Thorning, one of Capt.
Smith's Lincoln company, had fired on the
British from some hiding place in this neighborhood,
and they had returned his fire and chased
him into the woods. As he was thus escaping
the main body, he met the ever vigilant flank-guard,
and but narrowly escaped them also.
Later as they passed along, he advanced to one
of the Nelson bowlders and fired again, at the
British, probably with fatal effect. Across the
road from the house is a little knoll which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
called "The Soldiers' Graves,"<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> even to this
day, for therein sleep two British soldiers whose
summons undoubtedly came from behind the
Nelson bowlders.</p>

<p>About a sixth of a mile yet farther along,
stood the home of Samuel Hastings, near the
Lexington boundary line, yet within the town
of Lincoln. Hastings was a member of Capt.
Parker's Lexington Company,<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> and was present
and in line for action when Pitcairn gave that
first order to fire. As the British column swept
along, one of the soldiers left the ranks and
entered the house for plunder, unmindful of
the dangers lurking in the adjoining woods and
fields. As he emerged and stood on the door-stone,
an American bullet met him, and he
sank seriously wounded. There he lay, until
the family returned later in the afternoon, and
found him. Tenderly they carried him into
the house, and ministered to his wants as best
they could, but his wound was fatal. After his
death they found some of their silver spoons in
his pocket. He was buried a short distance
westerly from the house.<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>It was in Lincoln that Captain Parker's
Lexington Company, numbering in all one hundred
and <ins class="corr" title="Errata change&mdash;Original text: 'twenty'">forty</ins> men, again went into the action,
probably not far from the Nelson and Hastings
homes; and also the Cambridge Company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
under Capt. Samuel Thatcher, seventy-seven
men, joined the pursuit from there.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>The American fatalities in Lincoln, as we
have seen, were Capt. Jonathan Willson, of
Bedford; Nathaniel Wyman of Billerica, who
was a member of Capt. Parker's Lexington
Company; and Daniel Thompson of Woburn.
Job Lane of Bedford was slightly wounded.</p>

<p>The exact British loss in Lincoln cannot be
stated. It is known that eight were killed at
the Bloody Angle, and at least four more along
the road from there to the Hastings house.
Many were wounded but no statement or
estimate has ever been given. The distance
across that part of the town is about two miles,
and the fighting severe for more than half the
way.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<h2><a name="LIEUT-COL_SMITHS_RETREAT-2" id="LIEUT-COL_SMITHS_RETREAT-2"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">LIEUT.-COL. SMITH'S RETREAT
TO LEXINGTON VILLAGE.</a></h2>

<p>As the British forces again invaded Lexington
soil undoubtedly they looked for vengeance
from the hands of the little band that stood
before them in the early morning. If they did
anticipate as much they were not disappointed,
for as we have stated Captain Parker and his
men had come out into the edge of Lincoln to
meet them.</p>

<p>Just over the line into Lexington, and a few
rods north of the road, the land rises about
fifty feet rather abruptly and with a ledgy
face. This little summit commands a grand
view up and down the road, for quite a distance,
and therefore was an ideal location for the minute-men.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Many were there awaiting the passing
of the British, and when they were opposite,
poured down on them a volley. At least one
fell, an officer, for a few years ago a sword was
taken up from the depth of about four feet,
evidently from his grave. It was almost consumed
with rust, but enough remaining to
identify it as of British make and of that period.
The reports of muskets, and little puffs of blue
smoke betrayed the location of the marksmen,
and the British at once returned the fire. Their
aim was without effect. One of their bullets
flattened against the ledge, and was also found
by the present owner of the land, buried in the
decayed leaves and refuse at the base of the
ledge.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>Not more than a quarter of a mile farther
along the road, stood Bull's Tavern,<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> in later
times known as Viles Tavern. Nothing now
remains of it but the cellar-hole and that is not
so deep as once. The soldiers ransacked the
house for food and drink, but left no recompense.
A few rods more the road turns northeasterly
around a bluff twenty feet high, perhaps.
The struggle was renewed there furiously,
for the British flankers could not manœuvre to
protect the main column so well, and they
suffered severely for half a mile or more towards
Fiske Hill. Lieut.-Col. Smith was wounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
by a bullet passing through his leg.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Major
Pitcairn's horse becoming unmanageable through
fright, threw him to the ground, and escaped
into the American lines, where he was captured,
together with equipments, including the Major's
beautiful brace of pistols.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>Many British were wounded, and many
killed, along this part of Battle Road. A little
way from the bluff, over the wall on the opposite
side of the road and in a southerly direction,
are graves of two. No memorial stone marks
the exact spot, and even the mounds, too, have
long since dissolved away.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>The contending forces were now climbing
Fiske Hill, about sixty feet higher than the
bluff.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> The road at that time passed higher
up than at present, and near the summit
fighting was more severe again. One Briton,
at least, fell there and was buried in the little
strip of ground between the old and new road.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
A heap of small stones once marked the spot,
but they have disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>Down the easterly slope of Fiske Hill stands
a modest little farmhouse, on the southerly side
of the road. It was then the home of Benjamin
Fiske. The entire family had fled, and the
stragglers from the British columns entered for
pillage. One in his greed stayed too long.
Brave James Hayward of Acton, willing to fight
though exempt from military service because
of a partially dismembered foot, met him at the
door, laden with booty. The Briton recognized
in Hayward an enemy, and raising his
gun, exclaimed,</p>

<p>"You are a dead man!"</p>

<p>"And so are you," responded Hayward as he
raised his gun also. Both fired&mdash;both fell, the
British instantly killed and Hayward mortally
wounded, the ball piercing his bullet-pouch and
entering his side. He lived eight hours and
was conscious to the last. Calling for his
powder horn and bullet-pouch, he remarked
that he started with one pound of powder and
forty bullets. A very little powder and two or
three balls were all that were left.</p>

<p>"You see what I have been about," he exclaimed,
calling attention to the slight remainder.
"I am not sorry; I die willingly for my country."<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
And so Concord and Lexington, too,
reverently treasure the memory of brave Acton
men, whose life blood stained the soil of each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Up the westerly slope of Concord Hill, an
elevation named after her sister town, marched
the British. Their ranks were broken and
disordered. Many had been wounded, many
had been killed, and many had fallen exhausted
by the wayside. It was then about half past
one o'clock, and they had marched rather more
than twenty-three miles. At that time their
ammunition began to give out, which added to
their discomfiture. Their enemies seemed to
be countless and everywhere. De Bernicre,
the spy, who was with them, has left a vivid
word picture of how anxious they were getting.
"There could not be less than 5,000," he says
in his account, "so they kept the road always
lined, and a very hot fire on us without intermission....
We began to run rather than
retreat in order." Lieut.-Col. Smith, says, in
his report, that the firing on his troops, which
began in Concord, "increased to a very great
degree and continued without the intermission
of five minutes, altogether for I believe upwards
of eighteen miles."</p>

<p>Such was the impression on the minds of
Smith, and his weary soldiers as they hurried
along down Fiske Hill and up Concord Hill.
If he entertained any idea of surrendering,
though I have no evidence that he did, he must
have realized the hopelessness of that, for no
one seemed to be commanding the multitude
before him, beside him, and behind him. They
constituted a large circle of individuals, but
made no attempt to stay his march or guide it
in any way. They just followed along, seemingly
intent only on hunting down the King's
soldiers. Had some master mind been in charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of the patriot army, Smith's entire force could
easily have been taken prisoners. But this was
the first day of the war, and was only a contest
between soldiers and citizens. And so Smith
was allowed to march along.</p>

<p>Near the foot of the westerly slope of Concord
Hill stood the home of Thaddeus Reed.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> He
was one of Captain Parker's Company. After
the British passed along the Americans picked
up three severely wounded soldiers and carried
them into the house, where they all died. They
were buried not far away, a few feet westerly
of Wood St., on the northerly side of a stone
wall still standing, and but a few rods from
Battle Road. Their graves are unmarked and
almost unknown.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>The British flankers were now so thoroughly
tired out that they could hardly act in that
capacity, and were of but little use as protectors
of the main body. The severely wounded were
abandoned to some extent. Many of the
slightly wounded were carried along somehow,
but they greatly impeded the march. Hopes
of reinforcements were practically abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>And so they proceeded up the hill, the summit
of which is fully forty feet higher than
Fiske Hill and at least eighty feet higher than
Lexington Common,<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> now in view less than a
mile away. They must have been anxious to
reach and pass that little field. Down the
easterly slope of Concord Hill they almost ran,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
in more or less confusion and intense excitement.
The Americans were actively keeping
up their firing, and so more Britons were killed
and wounded, three of the latter so severely that
they were abandoned by their fellow soldiers,
fell into the hands of the Americans and were
taken into Buckman Tavern.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> One subsequently
died and was buried with the British
slain in the old cemetery near by. Their graves
are unmarked.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>The British did not stop to disperse any
rebels on Lexington Common, for none were
there to oppose their retreat, but passed off the
southeasterly point, as the Americans came
promptly after them on the northwesterly side.
It was between two and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'three o'clcok'">three o'clock</ins> when they
reached the site of the present Lexington High
School, a trifle more than half a mile from the
Common. There they met the long-wished for
reinforcements, under Lord Percy, who opened
his ranks, and enclosed them in his protecting
care. Many sank immediately into the road
where they halted, for their physical condition
was pitiful in the extreme. One of the contemporary
English historians, an officer in the
British Army in America, has described them
as lying prone on the ground, like dogs with
protruding tongues.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>Percy then quickly wheeled about his two
field pieces,<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> and opened fire up the road,
towards the Common, where he could see the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Americans were gathered. It was not fatal in
its effect, but served to scatter them and do
considerable damage to the meeting-house, one
ball passing through it. Col. Loammi Baldwin,
of Woburn, was one who had been standing in
sight of the British, but he sought shelter behind
the sacred edifice when he realized the
enemy had opened fire with artillery. When
a ball passed through the meeting-house and
came out near his head he retreated northwesterly
to the meadow.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>Not many of the Americans had been killed
thus far, in the retreat of the British through
Lexington. We have spoken of James Hayward
of Acton, killed on the easterly side of
Fiske Hill, and must add the name of Deacon
Josiah Haynes of Capt. Nixon's Sudbury Company,
who met his death somewhere along the
road from Fiske Hill to Lexington Common.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
He was a venerable man, in his seventy-ninth
year,<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> and had marched from his home down
to Concord village, up through Lincoln, and
into Lexington. He was thoroughly in earnest
in his work of driving the British back to
Boston, and in an unguarded moment exposed
himself to one of the King's riflemen.</p>

<p>On the Lexington part of Battle Road, many
British were killed and many wounded. Among
the latter were Lieut. Hawkshaw, Lieut. Cox,
and Lieut. Baker, all of the Fifth Regiment;
Ensign Baldwin and Lieut. McCloud, of the
Forty-seventh Regiment; and Captain Souter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and Lieut. Potter of the Marines.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> I have
previously mentioned the wounding of the commander,
Lieut.-Col. Smith, on the westerly
slope of Fiske Hill.</p>

<p>After the British had departed from Lexington
immediate attention was given to the Lexington
patriot dead who were slain on the
Common in the early morning. From the field
of battle they had been borne to the meeting-house,
and there a simple service held over them,
consisting of a prayer by Rev. Jonas Clarke.
Then they were carried to the little church-yard,
where one broad grave received them all.
It had been a day of terror in Lexington, and
some fear was felt that the enemy might return
and wreak yet further vengeance, even upon
the dead. So the grave was made in a remote
part of the yard, near the woods, and the fresh
mound of earth itself hidden beneath branches
cut from the neighboring trees.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> And not forgotten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
three score years later, their grateful
fellow townsmen removed their remains to the
field where they died, and erected a monument
to their memory.</p>

<h2><a name="EARL_PERCY_MARCHES_TO_REINFORCE" id="EARL_PERCY_MARCHES_TO_REINFORCE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">EARL PERCY MARCHES TO REINFORCE
LIEUT.-COL. SMITH.</a></h2>

<p>As the command of Lieut.-Col. Smith will
now rest for a brief period, let us go back to
Boston and start with Earl Percy, on his
mission to reinforce the former, and consider
his delays and difficulties, and why he got no
farther than Lexington.</p>

<p>As we have seen, it was between two and
three o'clock in the morning when Smith
reached Arlington, and <ins class="corr" title="Errata change&mdash;Original text: 'became'">becoming</ins> alarmed at the
increasing attention his soldiers were attracting;&mdash;attention
that seemed to him hostile, he
despatched back to Gen. Gage an urgent request
for reinforcements. His messenger should have
reached Gage within two hours easily, for to
retrace the march was less than six miles by
land with an additional half a mile or little
more by boat across the Charles River. So
Gen. Gage should have had Smith's message
by five o'clock, at least. He acted promptly,
by ordering the First Brigade, consisting of
eight companies of the Fourth, Twenty-third,
and Forty-seventh Regiments, under arms, and
to these were added two detachments of the
Royal Marines to be under Major John Pitcairn.
Two pieces of artillery, six-pounders, were also
added to the force, and the whole placed under
the command of Lord Percy, with the title, for
the occasion, of Acting Brigadier-General. His
little army numbered about one thousand men.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>It was about seven o'clock when the eight
companies assembled on Tremont Street, and
the line extended from Scollay Square to the
lower part of the Common. There they
waited for Pitcairn and his Marines, nearly
two hours. Finally it dawned upon the mind
of General Gage that his orders to that worthy
officer might still be lying on his desk unopened,
for he had been granted permission to accompany
Lieut.-Col. Smith as a volunteer, and
perhaps had gone. Such proved to be the case
and the two hours were lost. Then another
commander for them was selected, and they
were in line at nine o'clock.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> These two hours
would have meant Percy's force almost into
Concord instead of into Lexington village, and
would have made great difference in the results
of the day's fighting.</p>

<p>Percy, mounted on a beautiful white horse,
headed the column, and they proceeded over
Boston Neck, through the present Washington
Street, to Roxbury, up the hill to the meeting-house,
then to the right, where the old Parting
Stone then stood, even as it does to-day. In
Roxbury his soldiers excited the attention of a
very young patriot, who laughed derisively as
the musicians played "Yankee Doodle." Lord
Percy noticed him and asked the reason of his
mirth. The boy responded:</p>

<p>"To think how you will dance by-and-by to
Chevy Chase."</p>

<p>The British commander felt uncomfortable
the rest of the day because of the suggestive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and prophetic reply.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> He continued into
Brighton and to the westerly bank of the
Charles River, opposite to Harvard Square in
Cambridge. At that place the river is narrow
and thus easily bridged even in those early
days, and over that was then the only way
into Boston by road from the upper towns in
Middlesex County.</p>

<p>The Americans, anticipating Percy's movements,
had taken up the planks of the bridge,
but did not continue the good work thoroughly,
for they piled them handily on the Cambridge
side. It was a simple matter for Percy's engineers
to cross over on the stringers and re-lay
enough of them for his soldiers to pass into
Cambridge. But had the planks been farther
removed Percy was prepared to replace them,
for he had brought with him sufficient for the
purpose and carpenters to do the work. He
anticipated the partial destruction of the
bridge at least, and prepared his remedy accordingly,
and must have been surprised at the
point where the Americans concluded their
labors. He carried his planks along about a
mile and a half, and then sent them back as they
were only an encumbrance. He had no use for
them on his return for he had another plan, as
we shall see later on.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>It was at the bridge that Percy marched
ahead and left his wagon train of supplies to
follow on, as soon as they could safely cross.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
The delay to them was considerable and so the
main army soon passed out of sight.</p>

<p>The round about route the British had taken
to reach Harvard Square was necessary, at that
time, because as we have stated, no bridge
crossed the river lower down. Could he have
crossed as we do to-day, the distance would have
been but a little over three miles, whereas it
was eight miles as he marched, or nearly two
hours more time. He could not cross in boats
as did Lieut.-Col. Smith, for two reasons: first,
his soldiers were too many, and secondly, the
boats were even then moored on the Cambridge
side awaiting Smith's return.</p>

<p>When Percy reached Cambridge, he was somewhat
puzzled to know just which way to start
for Lexington. In his official report he declares
the houses were all shut up and there was not a
single inhabitant to give him any information
about the force under Smith. He did find one
man, Isaac Smith, a tutor in Harvard College,
who directed him along the right highway.
When his fellow citizens of Cambridge learned
of this free intelligence, a little later on, they
were indignant&mdash;and Isaac Smith, feeling
reproved, shortly afterwards left the country
for a while. It does not appear that he intended
to aid and abet the enemy, but granted
the little courtesy without thinking of its value.
It was regretted that Percy was not sent
down into the marshes bordering Willis Creek,
and so delayed an hour or more.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>The British marched rapidly on leaving
Harvard Square and were soon quite a distance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
ahead of the baggage train, deeming it safe to
leave it to follow under the guidance of a sergeant's
guard of twelve men. It was no small
task to get it safely over the dismantled bridge,
and the delay there was considerable. Vigilant
Americans watched the proceedings and realized
the opportunity to seize it. They hurried on
to Arlington to formulate their plans for its
capture. As Cambridge seemed to be generally
deserted, the sergeant and his men evidently
felt no uneasiness at their delay. In due time,
however, they were on the march again, headed
for Lexington.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>Not long after they passed the Charlestown
road, the Beech Street of today, Dr. Joseph
Warren and his friend Dr. Thomas Welsh came
into Cambridge. Warren lived in Boston, and
left his home that morning and crossed the
ferry into Charlestown. There he met Welsh
and many other citizens and communicated to
them the news he had received by special
messenger from Lexington. It was then about
ten o'clock.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> A little after, he and Dr. Welsh
on horseback, were on their way to Cambridge,
where they arrived, only to find the road ahead
occupied by the baggage-train. They endeavored
to pass but were not permitted to do
so. The sergeant inquired of Dr. Warren if he
knew where the British troops then were; but
the doctor could only give a negative reply.
There seemed to be quite a little uneasiness in
the minds of the British, as they evidently
feared they were too widely separated from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
main body and might be captured.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> A guard
of twelve men is not a large force to conduct
a baggage-train through a hostile country.
Percy's first and most serious mistake had been
committed. It was then noon-time, or a little
after.</p>

<p>In the meantime about a dozen of the elderly
men of Menotomy, exempts mostly, assembled
near the centre of the village and waited the
arrival of the baggage train. Among them
were Jason Belknap, Joe Belknap, James Budge,
Israel Mead, Ammi Cutter and David Lamson,
a half Indian. Some of them had served in
the French War. Rev. Phillips Payson, A.M.,
of Chelsea, was also present and took an active
part.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> They chose Lamson to be leader, and
took a position behind a stone wall on the northerly
side of the road, nearly opposite the First
Parish Meeting-House. As the baggage-train
appeared nearly opposite, Lamson ordered his
men to rest and aim at the horses, at the same
time calling out to the sergeant to surrender.
He made no reply, and his driver whipped up
the horses to escape. It was too late, for
American bullets easily stopped them, killed
two British soldiers and wounded several
others.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> The soldiers then abandoned their
charge and ran southerly along the westerly
shore of Spy Pond, as far as Spring Valley,
where they came upon an elderly lady of
Menotomy, known as Mother Bathericke,
engaged in digging dandelions. They begged
her assistance and protection, consequently she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
conducted them to the house of Capt. Ephraim
Frost, where they were detained as prisoners,<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
and probably to their mental relief. They
were thoughtful enough not to include their
guns in the surrender, for some were thrown into
Spy Pond, and one was ruined by striking it
heavily over a stone wall and bending it hopelessly
out of shape.</p>

<p>The captured wagons were drawn down
into the hollow, still to be seen a little northeasterly
of the present Arlington railroad
station, where the contents were distributed
freely to all comers. The living horses were
driven off to Medford, and the bodies of the
dead ones, in accordance with the suggestion
of the Rev. Mr. Cook, who feared exciting the
anger of the returning British, were dragged
away to the field near Spring Valley, westerly
of Spy Pond. And there, for many years, their
bones bleached in the sun.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>All other marks of the contest were obliterated
from the highway, that Percy might not trace
what had happened to his baggage-wagons and
wreak vengeance upon the townspeople.</p>

<p>Gen. Percy<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> marched less than two miles
beyond Arlington centre, when he distinctly
heard the firing in Lexington. He was not far
from the boundary line between Arlington and
Lexington and the time was, as he has written,
between one and two o'clock.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> At about that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
time he met Lieut. Gould of the Fourth, or
King's Own Regiment, who, as we have written,
was wounded at the North Bridge and was
then returning in a borrowed Concord chaise,
drawn by a borrowed Concord horse. From
him Percy learned the details of Lieut.-Col.
Smith's march, and of his present urgent need
of assistance. He hurried along towards Lexington,
and Lieut. Gould continued his retreat
towards Boston, but was captured as he reached
Arlington village. The exact spot was on the
present Massachusetts Avenue, near Mill Street,
and his captors were some of the old men who
had destroyed the baggage-wagons. Gould
was first taken to Ammi Cutter's, and then to
Medford,<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> and his own deposition shows that
he was kindly treated.</p>

<p>At last, after a march of nearly sixteen
miles,<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Percy met the returning force under
Lieut.-Col. Smith, who had passed Lexington
Common, the scene of his engagement in the
morning, and was down the road towards
Boston, half a mile. The place of meeting was
opposite the present Lexington High School,
and the time between two and three o'clock.
Percy being the ranking officer, immediately
took command of the united forces. It did
not take him long to realize the terrible condition
that Smith's troops were in, and to minister
to their wants. As they halted in the road, his
own ranks opened to receive them, and there
they sank to the ground utterly exhausted.
Such as could eat or drink were supplied from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
his own stores, while the wounded were taken
still farther down the road, less than a quarter
of a mile, to the Munroe Tavern, which he proceeded
to establish as his headquarters and for
use as a hospital. Near the place of meeting,
coming in from the eastward, was then and is
now, the Woburn road, the bordering walls of
which sheltered plenty of American minute-men.
Back a little to the southward rose the
modest elevation now sometimes called Mt.
Vernon. Americans were there also, for it was
high enough for them to look down on the
highway very nicely if permitted to do so.
Percy's flankers, however, were directed to clear
all surrounding locations of enemies to the
King, and Mt. Vernon and the Woburn road
were soon under the British flag again, or nearly
so. But occasionally from some obscure or
neglected corner, rose a puff of blue smoke and
then the wearer of that brilliant red uniform
would tumble over in the road, wounded or
dying, or dead. Little bodies of minute-men,
unorganized always, were seen dodging back
and forth around the meeting-house on the
Common. Other little groups, and many
singly, were noticed climbing over walls, emerging
from, and disappearing again, behind
clumps of bushes, and trees, and houses; hardly
ever in sight long enough to shoot at. Percy,
thinking to awe them, wheeled his two six-pounders
into position and opened his first
cannonade on the meeting-house on Lexington
Common. It was likewise the first cannon
fired in the American Revolution. No American
was killed, or even wounded, but the house of
God in Lexington suffered, and it cost the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>town some money to repair it. The cannon
ball crashing through the meeting-house did
have the effect to drive the Americans farther
back, and probably out of rifle range for a
while.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="P-IV" id="P-IV"></a>
<img src="images/i_122fp.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><em>Plate IV. A View of the South Part of Lexington</em></div>
</div>

<p>Percy having thus scattered his near-by
enemies then moved one of his six-pounders a
few rods down the road near the present Bloomfield
Street, then up the little elevation to the
southward, now called Mt. Vernon. The precise
spot was probably about opposite the
northerly end of the present Warren Street.
He strongly supported it with a part of his
brigade.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> This location was an excellent one
for artillery, as it commanded the highway
for fully a mile to Lexington Common and
beyond. As before, his gunner could find no
American long enough in one place to aim at.
So there were no fatalities.</p>

<p>While Smith's soldiers were resting, some of
those under Percy as reinforcements wandered
about that part of the village bent on mischief
and pillage, not the kind usually indulged in by
the average rowdy element of an army, but on
a much larger and grander scale. Houses and
outlying buildings were looted and burned.
The first ones were owned by Deacon Joseph
Loring, non-combatant, seventy-three years of
age, situated close by the meeting place of the
two detachments, on the westerly side of the
road. This group of buildings consisted of a
mansion house, a barn seventy-five feet long,
and a corn house. All were completely destroyed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
together with such of their contents as
could not be carried away. About two hundred
rods of Loring's stone walls were also
pushed over, emphasizing strongly the feeling
of hostility existing among the British soldiers
for their American cousins. His loss was £720.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>
This wanton and needless destruction of property
must have been by the express command
of Percy, for he was but a few rods away.</p>

<p>On the easterly side of the road, nearly opposite
the Loring house, standing on the site of
the present Russell House, was the home of
Matthew Mead. That, too, was within a few
rods of where Percy sat on his white horse, but
it was ransacked by his soldiers, and Mead's
loss was £101.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>Another plundered Lexington home in that
neighborhood belonged to Benjamin Merriam,
one of Parker's Company, and of course absent.
His house was not burned, but damaged to the
extent of £6. His loss of personal property
amounted to £217, 4s.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> The building is still
in existence, but has been moved easterly into
Woburn Street across the railroad tracks. Its
original location was on the westerly side of
Massachusetts Avenue, a few rods north of
Winthrop Road, and easily within sight of the
British commander, Lord Percy.</p>

<p>And let us not forget that from that time on,
Percy was in supreme command of the united
British forces, amounting to nearly eighteen
hundred men. To him belongs the credit of a
masterly retreat, for his loss in killed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
wounded was surprisingly small considering the
number of American riflemen in pursuit. To
him belongs the blame also for the burned
homes of inoffensive non-combatants, for the
killing of such helpless old men as Raymond;
for the summary removal of Hannah Adams
and her infant from child-bed; for the killing of
feeble-minded William Marcy; for the killing
of fourteen-year old Edward Barber. His
entire march back to Charlestown was thickly
dotted with just such incidents, unrelieved by
any conspicuous merciful action, or by any
deed of bravery. It was a masterly retreat,
indeed,&mdash;and it was a brutal one, too. Happily
for the American patriots in succeeding contests,
no other British commander seemed inspired
by such revengeful instincts. Happily for the
British historian he has no other such brutal
events to apologize or blush for. Percy occupies
his one page in history, uniquely, at least. His
services in America, terminated soon thereafter,
and at his own request, and for some reason
which we know not of. Possibly he was satisfied
with the fame, such as it was, which he won
on that glorious day.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>The next Lexington home to be destroyed by
the incendiary belonged to the widow Lydia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Mulliken and her son. It stood not far from
Loring's, on the main road to Boston, nearly
opposite the present Munroe School. The
clock shop connected with the same estate was
also burned. As in the previous cases such
personal effects as were desired by the soldiers
were first removed and subsequently carried
away. The works of a valuable musical clock
were found in the knapsack of a wounded Briton,
when he was subsequently captured.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> The
Mulliken loss was £431.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>John Mulliken, cabinet-maker, son of the
widow, and living in Concord, joined in the
pursuit, and came as far as Lexington. There
he saw his mother's house in flames, which
affected him so deeply that he could proceed no
farther.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>A modest little home and shop belonging to
Joshua Bond, standing northwesterly from
Munroe Tavern, and very near the present
beginning of "Percy Road," were first looted,
and then burned. His loss was £189, 16s. 7d.</p>

<p>The greater part of these happenings were
within that first half hour after Percy took
command of the united British forces, and
before he began his retreat. This energetic
destroyer of American homes had selected
Munroe Tavern as his temporary headquarters,
and ordered his wounded conveyed there also.
While their wounds were being dressed his men
demanded such refreshments as the place could
provide, and unlike Smith's subordinates in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Concord, were not considerate enough to pay
for them. So landlord William Munroe's loss
was £203, 11s. 9d., of which £90 was in the
"retail shop," presumably of a liquid nature.
As he was orderly sergeant in Captain Parker's
Company, he was naturally absent on duty,
and left a lame man, John Raymond, in charge,
who waited upon the unbidden guests because
he was compelled to. His last service was to
mix a glass of punch for one of the red-coats,
after which he essayed to escape through the
garden. He was not alert enough, for two
soldiers fired, and one of their bullets readily
overtook him as he hobbled away.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Thus one
more was added to the list of American dead,
one of the easiest victims, of course, for he was
simply an unarmed cripple. This probably
happened at the rear of the Tavern.</p>

<p>A few rods from the Tavern, down the road
towards Boston, were two more Lexington
homes, on opposite sides of the street, and so
quite near to each other. They are still standing
(1912). In the one on the westerly side
lived Samuel Sanderson, a member of Capt.
Parker's Company. He was not at home, so
they killed his cow instead, not for food, but
for the pure pleasure of killing something.
Evidently landlord Munroe's liquor was having
some effect, if not in making men braver, then
in making them more brutal. Sanderson did
not report the amount of his loss to the Legislature.
On the easterly side of the road lived
John Mason and family. All were absent so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the soldiers permitted themselves to carry
away property to the value of £14, 13s. 4d.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>Many other homes in Lexington were ransacked,
mostly during Percy's halt. The total
loss, as reported to the Legislature in 1783,
amounted to <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: '£1761, 1, 15;'">£1761, 1s. 5d.;</ins> nearly $9,000
as computed in money of to-day. Undoubtedly
many minor losses were not reported at all.</p>

<p>While these events were happening, the
American riflemen were not idle. From Mt.
Vernon to the westward, and from the Munroe
meadows to the eastward, came many leaden
messengers, some of them effective. Among
the British officers wounded, and probably most
of them during the halt, were Lieut. Hawkshaw,
Lieut. Cox, and Lieut. Baker, of the Fifth,
Ensign Baldwin and Lieut. McCloud of the
Forty-seventh; and Capt. Souter and Lieut.
Potter of the Marines. Many privates were
killed and wounded.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>Shortly after the meeting of Percy and
Smith, Gen. William Heath of Roxbury arrived
in Lexington, and endeavored to effect the
organization of the American forces into the
semblance of an army. Dr. Joseph Warren
arrived on the scene at the same time. Heath's
efforts were hardly successful, as the patriots
chose to fight as they had from the beginning,
singly and self-commanded. It appears that
Heath had first gone to Cambridge, to meet
the Committee of Safety, and from there intended
to go to Lexington, but fearing the
British were in possession of the road in that
direction had taken one across to Watertown.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Finding there some of the militia of the town
awaiting orders, he directed them to Cambridge
to take up the planks of the Boston bridge,
barricade its southerly end and dispute the
passage of the retreating British on their way
home to Boston. Then he proceeded to Lexington
and upon his arrival there was generally
recognized as the commanding officer of the
American forces. He found the people there
aroused to great excitement caused by the
bombardment of the meeting-house and the
burning of so many homes.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>It must have been half past three, or perhaps
nearly four o'clock, when Percy gave the order
to march. He realized the distance to Boston,
and the dangers along the way. "As it now
began to grow pretty late," he says in his
official report, "and we had 15 miles<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> to
retire, and only our 36 rounds, I ordered the
Grenadiers and Light Infantry to move off
first,<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> and covered them with my Brigade,
sending out very strong flanking parties."</p>

<p>The imposing display and the vigilant flankers
had the desired effect of keeping the Americans
at a comparatively safe distance, and so
Percy and his little army marched down through
East Lexington in safety.</p>

<p>The looting section picked up considerable
plunder from the abandoned homes along the
way, evidently without protest from the commander.
The march was a slow one, for
Smith's weary and wounded soldiers had to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
considered. Many of them were on the verge
of collapse and quite a few dropped out of the
ranks for good. De Bernicre in his account
places the "missing" at twenty-six. One of
these, a German, was discovered by the roadside
in East Lexington soon after Percy had
passed out of sight. He was well treated by
the Americans, and made his home among them
for many years.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>The Americans killed in Lexington during
the afternoon were Jedediah Munroe, and John
Raymond. The British loss was much greater,
for the Americans were being reinforced constantly
by minute-men from the remote towns.
Three companies from Newton entered the
battle at Lexington, under the command respectively
of <ins class="corr" title="Errata change&mdash;Original text: 'Capt. Phineas Cook, thirty-seven'">
Lieut. John Marean, thirty-eight</ins>
men; Capt. Amariah Fuller, one hundred and
six men; and Capt. Jeremiah Wiswell, seventy-six
men. Together these numbered two hundred
and nineteen men, making the total enrolment
of the Americans in pursuit of Percy as
he passed out of Lexington, <ins class="corr" title="Errata change&mdash;Original text: 'nineteen hundred and eighty-one'">
two thousand
and thirteen</ins> men.</p>

<p>It was not far from half past four when the
British crossed the Lexington line and entered
into Arlington. Their retreating march in
Lexington measured about two and one
quarter miles. Along the road they had striven
to kill in honorable battle. They had succeeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
but slightly, and paid an unusual price
with a much larger number of their own dead
and wounded. Percy's aim seemed to have
been to terrorize his opponents at whatever
cost. The life of Raymond was not taken in
battle, nor can rapine and incendiarism add
glory to his military renown. Lexington's
highway to Arlington ran between pillaged
and burning homes, and his soldiers staggered
along under heavy burdens of property stolen
from those whose King was his King. Concord
and Lincoln have none of Percy's deeds
related in their chronicles, but Lexington, and
Arlington, and Cambridge, and Somerville, and
Charlestown have good reason to remember his
terrible conception of warfare.</p>

<p>Gen. William Heath, as the commanding
officer of the Americans, endeavored to organize
his forces into something like an army. He
did not greatly succeed, but re-formed some of
the forces that had been scattered by Percy's
cannonade, directed towards the meeting-house
on Lexington Common.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>Descending the high lands in the upper part
of Arlington by the road, now known as Appleton
Street, that skirts along the base of Arlington
Heights, and drops to the "Foot of the Rocks,"
the Americans pressed in greater numbers and
greater courage on Percy's rear guard. The
bravery of individuals at this point became
conspicuous and often foolishly hazardous.
Percy, in his report, speaks of some concealed
in houses by the wayside, who would emerge
therefrom and approach within ten yards to
fire at him and his officers&mdash;though sure of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
fatal fire in return. He seemed surprised at
their enthusiasm, as he called it, evidently
forgetting how much he had excited their anger.
It is almost beyond belief that he could have
escaped through such a gauntlet, mounted as
he was, on his beautiful white horse, a conspicuous
mark from the hillsides along the way.
But he did,&mdash;for such is occasionally the
fortune of war as granted to brave men. His
personal courage was beyond question.</p>

<p>The forces of the Americans <ins class="corr" title="Errata change&mdash;Original text: 'was'">were</ins> greatly
augmented during the pursuit through Arlington.
Minute-men from the nearby Middlesex
towns, and from Essex and Norfolk counties,
arrived at the time and disposed themselves
along a line parallel to the highway as their individual
fancies dictated, and independent of any
commander-in-chief. Along the hillside to the
south, behind the walls, and even within buildings
adjacent to the road, they were posted,
singly and in squads, among them many
unerring marksmen, who added greatly to the
British loss in killed and wounded. Percy
would have been dismayed <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'had be known'">had he known</ins> the
number of reinforcements he must then contend
with, but they were not paraded for his
inspection. His own army at the highest had
not numbered over eighteen hundred men, but
now considerably depleted, by his losses along
the way, it is doubtful if it would equal fifteen
hundred really effective soldiers.</p>

<p>The Americans entering the contest at Arlington
were from Brookline, Capt. Thomas
White and ninety-five men, and possibly two
other companies under Col. Thos. Aspinwall and
Major Isaac Gardner, number of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
unknown;<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Watertown, Capt. Samuel Barnard,
one hundred and thirty-four men; Medford,

men, Capt. Asa Prince, thirty-seven men,
Capt. Edm. Putnam, seventeen men, Capt. John
Putnam, thirty-five men; Menotomy, Capt. Benjamin
Locke, <ins class="corr" title="Errata change&mdash;Original text: 'fifty-two'">fifty-three</ins> men. Undoubtedly some
of Locke's men were engaged earlier in the day,
particularly those who lived in Arlington, for
twenty-six of them assembled on the Common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
at daybreak, and must have gone up to Lexington,
at least. Of the other members, eleven
were from Charlestown, seven from Boston, three
from Stoneham, two from Lexington, one from
Newton, and one residence unknown. Together
these reinforcements at Arlington numbered
seventeen hundred and seventy-nine men.</p>

<p>Under the combined efforts of Gen. Heath
and Dr. Warren the minute-men were encouraged
to rally and draw nearer the rear
guard of Percy's column, to harass and destroy
them. The two British field pieces were often
turned on the Americans but were too cumbersome
for effective use against the elusive
minute-men. The cannon balls went tearing
up the road, smashing trees and shrubs, toppling
over stone walls, pushing jagged holes through
buildings, striking terror into the hearts of
women and children, and presumably many of
the men, who were unused to war.</p>

<p>This renewal of activities commenced in
Arlington where the road comes in from Lexington,
and skirts along the northerly base of
Peirce's Hill, now called Arlington Heights.
The descent from there to the plain is by a
steep grade and the lower end of that part of
the highway was then, and is now, known as
Foot of the Rocks. This skirting, curved
road around Peirce's Hill still exists. Its
westerly end is now called Paul Revere Road,
and its easterly end, Appleton St. Since that
time a straight road with gentler grade has been
made to connect the two ends of that part of
Battle Road, and forms a part of the new
Massachusetts Avenue from Boston to the
Concord line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>It was at the Foot of the Rocks that Dr.
Warren, brave even to recklessness, exposed
himself to some vigilant British marksman,
who could not fail to notice his enthusiasm and
influence. The bullet came dangerously near
the doctor's head, so near, in fact, as to strike a
pin from his ear-lock.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Here, also, Dr. Downer
of Roxbury engaged in single combat with a
British soldier, whom he slew with a bayonet
thrust.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>Towards the summit of Peirce's Hill was
the Robbins home. The family had fled.
Percy's flank-guard ransacked the house, built
a fire on the kitchen floor, which burned off a
line full of wet clothes hanging over it, letting
them fall into the flames which were thereby
extinguished.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<p>Down this road a little farther stood the
Tufts Tavern, once occupied by Mr. Cutler,
the rich farmer and butcher, but at that time
by John Tufts, previously of Medford, whose
wife was Rebecca, a daughter of Mr. Cutler.
It will be recalled that Tufts had been aroused
in the early morning by the British, and when
they returned the family had fled. Soldiers
broke into the upper end of it, loaded themselves
with such plunder as they could carry away,
and maliciously destroyed some that they were
obliged to leave behind. One thrust his bayonet
through the best mirror, the frame of which
was long preserved.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> While others, thinking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
to serve their King, opened the taps of the casks
containing molasses and spirits, allowing them
to escape. Then they set fire to the building,
and left in haste to rejoin their retreating companions.
A faithful colored slave of Mr.
Cutler's watching from a distance, entered soon
after their departure and extinguished the fire.</p>

<p>Richer plunder awaited the looters at the
home of Joseph Adams, a venerable deacon of
the Second Precinct Church. He had remained
at home with his family until Percy's troops
came into sight up the road. Then fearing his
outspoken views, strongly antagonistic to the
British ministry, might subject him to abuse
by Percy and his soldiers, he determined to
make his way across the fields to the Rev. Mr.
Cook's barn. He was seen, and a volley of
bullets followed, but he reached the barn, and
hid in the hay. Some of the soldiers followed,
even into the barn, and pierced the hay with
their bayonets, but he was not exactly there.
Some of them burst open the door of his home,
and three broke into the chamber, where lay
his wife and their infant child, but a few days
old. The mother was too ill to arise, even.
One of the soldiers opened the bed-curtains
and with fixed bayonet, pointing to her breast,
seemed about to slay her. She begged him not
to kill her, but he only angrily replied:</p>

<p>"Damn you!"</p>

<p>Another soldier, with a more humane heart,
interceded, and said,</p>

<p>"We will not kill the woman if she will go out
of the house, but we will surely burn it."</p>

<p>Inspired by the threat, Mrs. Adams then
arose, drew a blanket about herself and little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
infant,<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> and painfully made her way to the
corn-house close by. It was the first journey
since her illness, as far as her chamber door
even. Other children were left within the
house, but she was too weak to be of any assistance
to them. They had hidden under a bed,
but curiosity getting the better of Joel, aged
nine years, the little folks were all discovered,
but not harmed. They saw the sheets stripped
from the beds and household valuables dumped
into them, even including the works of an old
clock, an heirloom in the family. Most valuable
of all the booty, was the silver tankard
belonging to the communion service given to
the church in 1769, by Jonathan Butterfield.
It was subsequently pawned by the thief, to a
Boston silversmith, Austin by name, who read
the engraved inscription thereon and notified
Deacon Adams. After the evacuation of Boston
by the British, the two deacons redeemed the
tankard at their own expense, and returned it
to the church, where it is still in use.</p>

<p>The soldiers of Lord Percy, then emptied a
basket of chips on the floor, set them on fire
with a brand from the hearth, and went on
their way. The Adams children put out the
blaze with a quantity of home-brewed beer,
but not until the floor was badly burned, the
ceiling smoked and a quantity of pewter plates
on the dresser melted.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>A little farther along, on the westerly side of
the road, lived Jason Russell, aged fifty-eight
years.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Somewhat helpless because lame, he
had started with his family at noontime for
refuge at George Prentiss's on the hill. After
going a little way he felt impelled to return and
look after the safety of his home. He barricaded
his gate with bundles of shingles and from
behind them took his position to fire upon the
enemy as they should come along and pass by
in the road a rod away. Rather a feeble fortress
from any military standpoint, and one that
proved to be a death trap for its builder.
Northerly across the road and across the brook
lived Ammi Cutter, a kindly neighbor, who
came and pleaded with Russell to abandon his
door-yard for a place of greater safety. Russell
replied that "An Englishman's house is his
castle." Cutter remained by his side until the
advancing British were seen up the road, and
then started on the run across the road, over
the wall and through the fields towards his
home. Reaching the old mill-yard, and still
running, he stumbled and fell between two
logs, and the enemy's bullets scattered bark
over him as he lay. They thought him dead
because he fell as they fired, and so left him.
But he was entirely uninjured.</p>

<p>Back of the Russell house in a southerly
direction, the land slopes gently upward for a
little way, and then rises to a considerable
height. Near the foot of this hill a goodly
number of Americans were posted, among them
the men from Danvers. Approaching along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the slope of the hill, and parallel to the highway,
was a strong British flanking party driving all
before it. The Americans at that point were
too few to openly resist, so retreated and entered
the Russell house. Down the road came the
main body under Percy, and perceiving the
minute-men, advanced and opened fire. Russell
being lame, was the last to reach the door-way,
where two bullets felled him. The
soldiers rushed in and pierced him, as he lay,
with eleven bayonet thrusts. Then they entered
the house, and within that little home
enacted the bloodiest tragedy of the day.
Here, the seven men from Danvers were killed.
The other Americans retreated to the cellar,
and from the foot of the stairs threatened
death to any Briton who should come down.
One attempted to, and died on the way. Another
died in the struggle overhead. Then the
house was plundered in accordance with Percy's
method of warfare.</p>

<p>After the British had passed, the Americans
gathered at the home of Jason Russell. The
dead from the yard, and within the house, were
laid, side by side, in the little south room.
There were twelve of them, and the blood from
their wounds mingled in one common pool upon
the floor.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>The highway from Jason Russell's house, to
the centre of Arlington village, proved to be
the bloodiest half mile of all the Battle Road.
Within this little stretch were killed twenty or
more Americans, and as many or more Britons.
And here, on the northerly side of the road,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
not far from where the British convoy was
captured, in the forenoon, stood another
Adams home. It was punctured with bullets
and it was stained with blood, for the dead and
dying and wounded were carried there after
the combatants had passed on.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>One of the most unequal duels of any war
was fought near here, between the venerable
Samuel Whittemore, aged eighty years, and a
number of British soldiers, acting as a flanking
party, on the easterly side of the road.</p>

<p>Whittemore lived with a son and grandchildren
near Menotomy River, and had been
aroused early in the morning by the passing of
Smith's forces on their way to Concord. Mrs.
Whittemore then commenced her preparations
for flight, to another son's house, near Mystic
River, towards Medford. She supposed that
her husband intended to accompany her, but
was surprised to find him engaged in the warlike
occupation of oiling his musket and pistols,
and sharpening his sword. In his younger
days he had been an officer in the militia. She
urged him to accompany her and the children.
He refused, with the excuse that he was going
"up town" as he expressed it. He did so,
arriving there before the British had returned.
When they reached the neighborhood of the
present railroad crossing they halted, some
of them opposite Mystic Street. Whittemore
had posted himself behind a stone wall, down
Mystic Street about four hundred and fifty feet,
near the corner of the present Chestnut Street.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
The distance seemed an easy range for him, and
he opened fire killing the soldier he aimed at.
They must have discovered his hiding-place
from the smoke-puff, and hastened to close in
on him. With one pistol he killed the second
Briton, and with his other fatally wounded a
third one. In the meantime the ever vigilant
flank-guard were attracted to the contest, and
a ball from one of their muskets struck his head
and rendered him unconscious. They rushed
to the spot, and clubbed him with their muskets
and pierced him with their bayonets
until they felt sure that he was dead. Soon
after they left him, he was found by the Americans,
and as he seemed to still live they bore
him to the Cooper Tavern. Dr. Tufts of
Medford was summoned, but declared it useless
to dress so many wounds as the aged man could
not possibly survive. However, he was persuaded
to try, and Whittemore lived eighteen
more years, dying in 1793, at the age of ninety-eight.
When he was recovering, his wife
could not forbear asking him if he did not
regret he had not remained with the rest of
the family from the first. But the old hero,
still suffering from his many wounds, replied:</p>

<p>"No! I would run the same chance again."<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>Four hundred feet farther along, at the
corner of the Medford road, now Medford
Street, stood the Cooper Tavern, Benjamin
Cooper, landlord. He and his wife, Rachel,
were mixing flip at the bar. Two of their
guests, and possibly those two were all at the
time, were Jason Winship, about forty-five
years old, and his brother-in-law, Jabez Wyman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
in his fortieth year.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Evidently they were
non-combatants, and as such expected to
remain unmolested. But the soldiers were
lashed to a fury by the reception they had met
along the road, particularly that of the last
half mile. So many houses along back had
concealed minute-men, that about all were
freely riddled with bullets, then ransacked,
and then set on fire. Cooper Tavern was not
considered by them as a privileged exception.
More than a hundred bullets were fired into it
through the doors and windows. Then the
soldiers entered for their finishing strokes.
Mr. and Mrs. Cooper escaped to the cellar, but
Wyman and Winship, both unarmed, were
stabbed in many places, their heads mauled
until their skulls were broken, and brains
scattered about on the floor and walls.<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>The death of these two unarmed men, formed
the climax of Arlington's part of the battle,
for Percy's troops passed through the rest of
the town, and crossed Menotomy River into
Cambridge without further bloody incident.</p>

<p>The Americans who were killed in Arlington,
were Jason Russell, Jason Winship and Jabez
Wyman of Arlington; Reuben Kennison, of
Beverly; Samuel Cook, Benjamin Daland,
Ebenezer Goldthwait, Henry Jacobs, Perley
Putnam, George Southwick, and Jotham Webb,
of Danvers; Elias Haven of Dedham; William
Flint, Thomas Hadley, Abednego Ramsdell, and
Daniel Townsend, of Lynn; William Polly and
Henry Putnam, of Medford; Lieut. John Bacon,
Nathaniel Chamberlain, Amos Mills, Sergt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Elisha Mills, and Jonathan Parker of Needham;
Benjamin Peirce of Salem; and Jacob Coolidge
of Watertown. These numbered twenty-five,
and constituted half of all the Americans killed
during the day.</p>

<p>The wounded in Arlington were Samuel
Whittemore, of Arlington; Nathaniel Cleaves,
Samuel Woodbury, and William Dodge, 3rd, of
Beverly; Nathan Putnam, and Dennison Wallace
of Danvers; Israel Everett of Dedham;
Eleazer Kingsbury, and a son of Dr. Tolman, of
Needham. They numbered nine out of the
thirty-nine Americans wounded during the day.</p>

<p>The British killed in Arlington were at least
forty, more than half of all their loss during the
day.</p>

<p>The patriot dead of old Menotomy and her
sister towns were gathered, and twelve of them
placed on a sled and drawn by a yoke of oxen
to the little village church-yard. There they
were laid away in one large grave, side by side,
in the same bloody garments they wore when
they fell. One monument marks the place.
In the meeting-house close by, friends and
relatives met on the following Sabbath, and,
we are told that among them were Anna,
infant grand-daughter of Jason Russell, born
on the day of the battle, and the little son of
Jason Winship, who was brought to the altar
for baptism. It must have been a sacred and
patriotic consecration for all.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> Some of the
other slain from distant towns, were borne by
their comrades back to their own homes.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>In Arlington, then, as the casualties show,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the battle reached its climax. The savage
ferocity of the personal encounters show to
what a maddening frenzy the King's troops had
been wrought. As in Lexington, Percy attempted
the wholesale destruction of the
American homes by the torch, but so closely
had he been followed by the ever-increasing
minute-men, that his efforts were futile. His
soldiers had the time to start the fires, but not
the time to fan them into conflagrations, and
thus old Menotomy escaped the fate of Lexington.</p>

<p>Percy continued his march through the
town of Arlington, crossing Menotomy River
into Cambridge between five and six o'clock.
The minute-men hovered dangerously near
his rear guard so that he paused often long
enough to wheel his two six-pounders about
and prevent them from coming too near. They
were entirely without fatal effect, but inspired
at all times a wholesome respect, and kept
the Americans farther away.</p>


<p class="p2" />
<h2><a name="PERCYS_RETREAT_THROUGH_CAMBRIDGE" id="PERCYS_RETREAT_THROUGH_CAMBRIDGE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PERCY'S RETREAT THROUGH CAMBRIDGE.</a></h2>

<p>Occasionally the contest narrowed down to
personal encounters between two or more. It
was near the Menotomy River, on the Cambridge
side, that Lieut. Bowman, of Arlington,
overtook a straggler from the British ranks, and
engaged him in single combat. Both had guns,
but neither one was loaded. The Briton
rushed at Bowman with fixed bayonet, but the
latter warded it off, and with his musket clubbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
his antagonist to the ground. Then he took
him prisoner.<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>Cambridge was the home of Capt. Samuel
Thatcher's company of seventy-seven men, but
it is probable that Smith had encountered them
as far back as Lincoln, for the muster roll in the
Massachusetts Archives states that most of
them marched twenty-eight miles, which would
mean up into Lincoln and return, and to
Charlestown Neck and return.</p>

<p>Percy's march through Cambridge, from
Menotomy River to the Somerville line, measured
nearly a mile and a quarter. The provincials
expected that he would return to
Boston by the route he came out, that is through
Harvard Square over Charles River bridge into
Brighton, thence through Roxbury, and along
Boston Neck and into Boston. Anticipating
as much, it was ordered that the bridge should
be made impassable. But Percy deemed it
wise to hurry on to Charlestown, trusting that
Gen. Gage would have an ample force there to
receive and protect him. It was several miles
nearer, and with no possibility of dismantled
bridges to reconstruct, for his troops to pass over.
Nor should it be forgotten that Percy's original
plan was to remain that night, at least, in
Harvard Square, but he had not counted on
such intense hostility, from so large an army
of minute-men in open rebellion. He deemed
it wiser, therefore, to move constantly forward
towards the main army.</p>

<p>This mile and a quarter in Cambridge proved
to be one of continual battle, also. The
Americans were ever on the alert, and growing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
more and more active as they realized more
and more the real meaning of the invasion.
The sight of many of the British soldiers loaded
down with plunder; the curling smoke and
flames from American dwellings; the dying and
the dead, some of them horribly mutilated,
scattered all along the highway, were at last
inspiring an intense feeling of hatred, and a
longing for a satisfying vengeance. Percy's
army experienced practically the same sensations.
Trained as soldiers to the usages of
open warfare, they deemed the frontier method
of fighting as unfair and cowardly. They held
in contempt the man who should remain concealed
in safety and shoot down one who was
compelled to remain in the open. Undoubtedly,
too, the memory of a comrade, lying at the
North Bridge with that ugly hatchet death-wound
in the head, aroused the most savage
instincts, that seemed to cry for brutal retaliation.
Whittemore, and Wyman, and Winship
seem to have been victims of vengeance rather
than of war.</p>

<p>The Americans did not profit much by the
lessons which they had received, earlier in the
day, for they again fell victims to the British
flankers. Quite a number had gathered near
the home of Jacob Watson, situated on the
southerly side of the highway near the present
Rindge Avenue. Their fragile security was a
pile of empty casks, not far from the road, from
behind which they awaited the oncoming of
the British. But the flank-guard came up in
their rear, unobserved, and completely surprised
them, killing Major Isaac Gardner of
Brookline, a favorite son of that town, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
first graduate of Harvard College to fall in the
War, and two Cambridge men, John Hicks,
nearly fifty years old, and Moses Richardson,
fifty-three years old. And near the same place,
another Cambridge man, William Marcy, as
tradition says<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> of feeble intellect, and a non-combatant.
He was sitting on the fence,
evidently enjoying the military spectacle, and
perhaps good-naturedly cheering on the marching
red-coats. His friendly demonstrations
were entirely mistaken for shouts of derision.
In the midst of his simple pleasure, some Briton
esteemed it his duty to kill him as an enemy of
the King.</p>

<p>The British loss at this place was but one
killed.</p>

<p>On they marched, wheeling to the left, into
Beech Street, a thoroughfare about seven
hundred feet long, and thence out of Cambridge
and into Somerville.</p>

<p>Soon after this, the wife of John Hicks, whose
home is still standing (1912) at the corner of
<ins class="corr" title="Errata change&mdash;Original text: 'Dusnster'">Dunster</ins> and Winthrop Streets, fearing for his
safety, sent her son, fourteen years of age, to look
for him. He had been absent since morning, and
undoubtedly the noise of battle, a mile and a
quarter away, coming across the fields, bore a
sad burden of prophecy. Her misgivings were
well founded, for the son found his father by
the roadside where he fell, and near him the
others.</p>

<p>The body of Isaac Gardner was taken to
Brookline and there buried the next day. The
remains of John Hicks, Moses Richardson and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
William Marcy, were immediately taken to
the little churchyard near the Common, a mile
from where they fell. They were buried in
one grave, without coffins or shrouds even. A
son of Moses Richardson, standing by, realizing
that the earth was to fall directly on their faces,
jumped down into the grave and arranged the
cape of his father's coat, that it might shield
him somewhat from the falling earth.</p>

<p>We may wonder now, at that hasty burial,
without much, if any, ceremony; but let us
associate with it the trail of the invading army,
and of what seemed possible for the morrow,
if it should return, greatly reinforced, for
vengeance. Boston was not far away, and
Gen. Gage, even then, might be preparing to
move on Cambridge, with a force sufficiently
large for its subjection. The Americans did not
fully realize their own power or their own
courage, not even as well as Gen. Gage did,
who wisely decreed to remain in Boston and
Charlestown, and decide later whether to pursue
an aggressive or a defensive campaign.
The spontaneous rousing of the country was
an impressive one to the British commander.</p>

<p>It had evidently been Percy's plan to camp
on Cambridge Common that night, and while
awaiting expected reinforcements, or upon their
arrival, lay the buildings of Harvard College,
and others, in ruins. Such a course would have
been in harmony with his warfare in Lexington
and Arlington, and serve as a practical lesson
to those in rebellion, of the disposition and
readiness of their King to wreak a swift and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
terrible vengeance upon his enemies.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> But
Percy's plans were rudely disarranged, and he
commenced to realize that he was really being
driven back to Boston.</p>

<h2><a name="PERCYS_RETREAT_THROUGH_SOMERVILLE" id="PERCYS_RETREAT_THROUGH_SOMERVILLE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PERCY'S RETREAT THROUGH SOMERVILLE.</a></h2>

<p>It was about half past six o'clock when Percy
left Cambridge and entered the present city of
Somerville, crossing the line at the corner of
Beech and Elm Streets. Just about at the
Somerville line the battle was hotly renewed.
Near the corner of Beech Street, and on the
easterly side of Elm Street, stood, and still
stands (1912), the house of Timothy Tufts.
Here Percy halted his army while his two field-pieces
were dragged up the hill back of the
Tufts house and discharged towards his pursuers,
with the usual result of his cannonading&mdash;none
killed. From out a grove a little way
up the road, came a scattering fire of American
sharpshooters and in consequence quite a
number of Britons were killed. They fell in
the road, just in front of the Tufts house, and
a tablet there marks where they were buried.</p>

</div>

<p>Along Elm Street to Oak Street, and then
continuing in Somerville Avenue, was their
route, when the march was resumed. At the
foot of Laurel Street on Somerville Avenue was
then a little pond. Into that many weary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Britons threw themselves&mdash;some for the refreshing
plunge, others to quench their thirst.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>Their march was continued rapidly now, and
in consequence the fatalities on the American
side were slight, if any, on the road from the
Tufts house through Bow Street, for that was a
part of Battle Road then, to Union Square.
From the latter place they continued through
Washington Street, where the American sharpshooters
had a grand opportunity to renew
their havoc. Washington Street skirts along
the westerly foot of Prospect Hill, the summit
of which commands easily a stretch of highway
for more than half a mile. Many were killed
and wounded, some of the latter of whom were
taken into the house then standing at the
corner of Washington and Prospect Streets.
Here Percy paused long enough to train his
two field pieces up the road, and again with his
usual lack of fatal results. But he checked the
Americans.</p>

<p>A little way farther along on the northerly
side of the road, stood the home of Samuel
Shed. Percy's troops halted there, for the few
moments necessary to turn his field pieces on his
pursuers again. While there one of the Britons,
ambitious for plunder, entered the Shed home,
and finding there a bureau or highboy filled
with household effects, commenced the work
of selecting what he desired. It took him too
long, for his companions passed on, and left
him still too busy to notice their departure or
the coming of the Americans. Bullets came
through the window, one of which killed him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and three riddled the old bureau, spattering his
blood over it, and on the floor.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>A few rods farther, the grassy slope of Prospect
Hill descended in a southerly direction to
Washington Street, then called the Cambridge
Road. James Miller, about sixty-six years old,
stood there awaiting the British. With him
was a companion, and both fired with deadly
effect, again and again, as the British marched
by in the road below. They were discovered
finally, and Miller's companion urged him to
retreat.</p>

<p>"Come, Miller, we've got to go."</p>

<p>"I'm too old to run," replied Miller, and he
remained only to be pierced with a volley of
thirteen bullets.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> His home was but a short
distance down the road, and is still standing,
next to the house on the easterly corner of
Washington and Franklin Streets.</p>

<p>Miller was the only American killed in
Somerville, as the British were in too full
retreat to act very much on the aggressive.
Their loss was considerable, however, and along
the entire Battle Road, for the minute-men
were exceedingly active in the rear and on the
northerly side of the road, particularly.</p>

<p>The policy of property destruction was continued
by Percy through Somerville. The
limited time at his command did not allow of
very thorough work, but he accomplished something.
The estate of James Miller whom they
killed on the slope of Prospect Hill, was damaged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
to the extent of £4, 12s. ($23.00). Ebenezer
Shed lost his house, barn, and another
building, valued at £140 ($700), and the
damage to his crop, fences, etc., he estimated at
£279, 3s. 2d. ($1395.79). The widow of
Abigal Shed suffered to some extent in the
same way.<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>


<p class="p2" />
<h2><a name="PERCYS_ARRIVAL_IN_CHARLESTOWN" id="PERCYS_ARRIVAL_IN_CHARLESTOWN"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PERCY'S ARRIVAL IN CHARLESTOWN.</a></h2>

<p>The sun set at seven o'clock on that nineteenth
day of April, in 1775.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> It never rose
again on Middlesex County under kingly rule.
Percy must have been in the vicinity of Union
Square, Somerville, at that particular moment.
The pauses for his artillery demonstration; the
destruction of the few buildings; the killing of
Miller; and the hurried march to the Charlestown
line, did not occupy more than half an
hour. It was just dark enough for the musket
flashes to be seen across the marshes and across
the waters of the Charles River to the Boston
shore, where were grouped anxious watchers
awaiting the news of battle.</p>

<p>Percy's thirty-six rounds for each of his
soldiers had been about all expended. He
describes the fire all around his marching
column as "incessant," coming from behind
stone walls, and from houses that he at first
supposed had been evacuated.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<div class="caption">GENERAL WILLIAM HEATH.</div>
</div>

<p>Charlestown Common, now Sullivan Square,
was soon reached, and his column gladly
wheeled to the right and marched up Bunker
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Hill. As they did so, a mile away, on top of
Winter Hill, in Somerville, were just then
arriving three hundred more Americans, who
had marched from Salem under Col. Timothy
Pickering. They were half an hour late to be
particularly effective. No blame can be attached
to them for that, for there were thousands
of other minute-men, from distant towns
who were also late, for April 19th, but who
were in ample time to join the besieging army
on April 20th.</p>

<p>At Charlestown Common, on the corner of
the road to the Penny Ferry which crossed the
Mystic River to Everett,<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> stood the home of
William Barber, sea captain. His family consisted
of his wife, Anne Hay, and their thirteen
children. One of them, Edward, fourteen years
old, sat at the window looking out upon the
brilliant pageant of marching soldiers in the
road. Many of the soldiers must have seen
him, for he was not in hiding. One did, at all
events, and with that thirst for killing some
one, even though but a boy, shot him and saw
him fall back into the room dead. Thus
Edward Barber became Charlestown's martyr
of April 19th.</p>

<p>While Charlestown did not officially contribute
to the organized minute-men who were
pursuing Percy, yet many individuals must have
been in the American ranks on that day, for in
the afternoon Gen. Gage wrote to James
Russell of Charlestown that he had been informed
people of that town had gone out armed
to oppose His Majesty's Troops, and that if a
single man more went out armed, the most
disagreeable consequences might be expected.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
The people of Charlestown indeed had reason
to be in terror, surrounded as they were by the
soldiers, frenzied with their disastrous retreat
from Lexington. The Selectmen arranged with
Percy an armistice, agreeing that the troops
should not be attacked, and that assistance
should be given in getting them across the ferry
to Boston, provided they would not attack the
citizens or destroy their homes. This agreement
seems to have been kept in good faith by
both parties.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> British officers walked up and
down the streets, directing the women to keep
within doors.</p>

<p>Percy's force remained on Bunker Hill until
arrangements were completed for their trip
across the Charles River to Boston. The
wounded were sent over first, being conveyed
by the boats of the <i>Somerset</i> man-of-war, which
still lay there, as it did when Revere crossed
the night before.</p>

<p>Gen. Gage sent pickets from Boston, selected
from the Tenth and Sixty-fourth Regiments to
do guard duty in Charlestown.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>Gen. William Heath, as commander of the
American forces, assembled the officers of the
minute-men at the foot of Prospect Hill, in
Somerville, for a Council of War. Then he
ordered the formation of a guard to be posted
near, and sentinels along the road now known
as Washington Street in Somerville, and Cambridge
Street in Charlestown, to Charlestown
Neck. The remainder of the force was ordered
back to Cambridge,<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> which place was to be for
a while the Headquarters of the American Army.</p>

<h2><a name="ENGLISH_FRIENDS_AFTER_THE" id="ENGLISH_FRIENDS_AFTER_THE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">ENGLISH FRIENDS AFTER THE
BATTLE.</a></h2>

<p>As in the beginning of this little history we
gratefully chronicled the warm and sympathetic
friendship for America that permeated
the British nation, and particularly the councils
of Parliament, so as we close, we may glance
across the ocean again to see if that same
friendship can survive the shock of rebellion
against the King. In quarrels of a family
nature one does not feel unpatriotic if he
happens to espouse the cause of the minority.
So it was with John Horne Tooke.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> His
intense friendship for this part of the British
Kingdom was evident at the start and reached
a decided climax after the battle. He was a
member of the Constitutional Society, and
during an adjournment or recess of a meeting
held June 7th proposed that a subscription
should be immediately entered into "for raising
the sum of one hundred pounds, to be applied
to the relief of the widows, orphans, and aged
parents, of our beloved American fellow-subjects,
who, faithful to the character of
Englishmen, preferring death to slavery, were,
for that reason only, inhumanly murdered by
the King's troops at or near Lexington and
Concord." The money was raised and placed
at the disposal of Benjamin Franklin, to distribute
in accordance with its purpose. The
resolution was forwarded to several newspapers,
and its publication naturally aroused considerable
surprise and painful comment.</p>

<p>Mr. Horne was arrested and tried for "a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
false, wicked, malicious, scandalous and seditious
libel of, and concerning, his said Majesty's
government, and the employment of his troops,"
etc.<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> He was found guilty and sentenced to a
fine of £200; to be imprisoned for twelve
months; and that he find securities in £800 for
his good behavior, for three years.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>I have not read of any other Briton punished
to that extent at that time, for friendship for
his fellow subjects on this side of the ocean.
There were many as sincere and devoted to the
cause of the colonists as Horne, and perhaps
as openly, too, but he happened to be the one
selected to bear the heavy burden of his King's
displeasure.</p>

<p>On a much larger and more impressive scale
was the petition of the Lord Mayor, Aldermen,
and Commons, of the City of London, in
Common Council assembled, to the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament assembled.
It was presented in October, and
recited how that body had "taken into the most
serious consideration the present distressed
situation of our fellow subjects in America,"
and concluded with the prayer that the House
would be "pleased to adopt such measures for
the healing of the present unhappy disputes
between the mother country and the colonies,
as may be speedy, permanent and honourable."</p>

<p>But the wise counsels of the great city did
not prevail in the House of Parliament, for that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
body simply ordered their petition to "lie upon
the table."<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p>So was fought the opening battle of the
American Revolution, the beginning of that
long struggle which rent in twain the great
English nation, and gave birth to these United
States.</p>

of the strenuous ride of Revere, but it is probable that his second
rider may have been equally or more of a contributory cause, as
Revere's ride was not long and fast enough to kill a horse in sound
condition.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_58" id="Footnote_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58"><span class="label">[58]</span></a> It has sometimes been written that Hancock and Adams first
went to a little wooded hill southeasterly from the parsonage
overlooking Lexington Common, and perhaps half a mile away,
and where they remained concealed until after the British had
passed, and that Adams, looking down upon that first scene of
bloodshed expressed himself as above quoted. But I cannot reconcile
that statement with Revere's own version of the flight wherein
he speaks of going with them two miles and then returning for
Hancock's trunk at the Buckman Tavern, and which he succeeded
in getting just before the British arrived there at five o'clock.
Thus Adams could not have witnessed the opening scene on Lexington
Common.</p></div>

<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'In a article'">In an article</ins> on the Munroe Tavern in the Proceedings of the
Lexington Hist. Soc., III., 146, Albert W. Bryant recites a tradition
that the information of ten British officers riding up the road
was given to Sergeant Munroe, who gave the first general alarm
that assembled Captain Parker's Company. A messenger later
was sent down the road on a scouting trip for the British, but who
did not return. A second was sent who did not return. A third
was sent who also did not return. A fourth was despatched who
did return with the news that the British Army was really marching
on Lexington, and that the previous messengers who had been
sent down the road had met and passed two or more British soldiers
riding in advance of the main body, who then closed in on them
as prisoners. The horse of the fourth messenger had become
frightened at the two advancing Britons and turned back in spite
of his rider, who caught a glimpse of the British front ranks on the
march. [This last messenger was Captain Thaddeus Bowman,
F.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;C.]</p></div>

o'clock, and De Bernicre, in his report, at about two o'clock, but I
am compelled to compute it about one o'clock considering the distance
they had to march and the well known time they arrived at
Lexington Common, viz., almost eleven miles and reaching there
at half past four.</p></div>

letter of W. S. Evelyn, who was with Percy; De Bernicre's Account,
and Lieut.-Col. Smith's Report. It seems to me of but little
moment as to who fired first. The council of war, convened by
Gen. Gage, April 18, wherein it was determined to march out and
destroy the public stores of Massachusetts was the first real hostile
act and could only lead to war. Major Pitcairn has denied that he
authorized that first shot. I believe him to have been gruff and
profane, but honest, brave, and faithful to his King. He died
from wounds received in the Battle of Bunker Hill.</p></div>

feet. There he found the sword and a little of its rust-eaten
scabbard, and quite likely in the grave by the side of its wearer.

behalf of the owner, a widow of John P. Putnam, of Cambridge,
N. Y., who was the grandson of Gen. Putnam and to whom they
descended. Later Mrs. Putnam gave them to the town of Lexington
and they are now on exhibition by the Lexington Historical
Society (See Handbook of Lexington, 1891.) Rev. William Emerson
of Concord, requested of the Third Provincial Congress, June 1,
1775, the use of a horse, probably Pitcairn's, which they granted

I am indebted to the Lexington Historical Society, Proceedings,
Vol. IV, page 92, for the above extract from a letter written by Miss
Elizabeth Clarke, daughter of Rev. Jonas Clarke. It is dated from
Lexington, April 19, 1841, and written to her niece, Mrs. Lucy Ware
Allen, whose mother was Mary, another daughter of Rev. Mr.
Clarke. The writer, Miss Elizabeth, was then in her seventy-eighth
year. I am inclined to think that Asahel Porter, the Woburn
man, was buried in his own town. Though killed near the Common
he was not one of Capt. Parker's Company.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_276" id="Footnote_276"></a><a href="#FNanchor_276"><span class="label">[276]</span></a> A majority of the voters of Lexington in town meeting
assembled have re-named a near-by street, "Percy Road," in commemoration
of his visit on that Nineteenth of April. Almost
any other foeman's name would have been better, if it is thus
necessary to mark a growing feeling of respect and kindliness between
two nations of kindred blood. Its older name was Mt.
Vernon Street!</p>

<p>The town has many street names in memory of that battle day,
such as Adams, Clarke, Hancock, Muzzey, Revere. Percy Road
starts from near the old Munroe Tavern. What better name could
there be for this thoroughfare than Munroe Avenue, in memory of
Sergeant William Munroe, or of his grandson James S. Munroe, who
has generously left the Tavern to be forever open to the public for
inspection.</p></div>

<h2><a name="PREFACE-1" id="PREFACE-1">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>I have copied the greater part of these patriotic
names from the original Rolls in the Archives of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, where they were
filed soon after the battle of April 19, 1775, as claims
against the State for services on that and succeeding
days.</p>

<p>These Companies were all participants, with the exception
of those of Dracut, Stow and Westford. I
have given them, as they came so nearly into the contest.
We know there were scores of others also, who
started with the same patriotic fervor, but who were
too many miles away. Their records of time and distances
are also in the State Archives.</p>

<p>Of all the participating Companies, as I have given
them, there were but ten that filed no claims for services
rendered, and they were: two from Acton, the
one from Arlington, two from Brookline, the four
from Concord, and the one from Lexington. I am
able to give the Rolls of four of those (perhaps imperfectly),
but cannot give the two of Acton, two of
Brookline, and two of Concord.</p>

<p>I have made no attempt to correct the spelling of
names, believing such a task to be beyond my ability,
and I imagine the interested reader would much prefer,
himself or herself, to make any such change in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_4" id="Page_4_4">[4]</a></span>
the family name as may be deemed necessary or fitting.</p>

<p>In most of the Rolls the names of the slain are
omitted. I have not attempted to restore them, as I
am not sure in every case to which Company they
may have belonged. They will be found, however,
in the preceding part of this book as the "Americans
Killed, Wounded, and Missing."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Captain John Parker's Company.</span></h3>

<p class="pfs90 smcap">On Lexington Common, and the First Company in the
Contest.</p>

<p>As no claim for services on April 19 was filed with
the Commonwealth, I have no official Roll. Hudson,
in his "History of Lexington," gives the names of
one hundred and twenty as constituting the Company,
and in the genealogical department of the same work
gives several others. In the depositions of participants
published in the "Journals of Each Provincial
Congress of Massachusetts, 1774-5," are quite a number
who named themselves as of Parker's Company,
one of them being Phillip Russell; and Moses
Harrington, in the same, places "Jr." after his name.
In this Company I have also included the two Woburn
men, Robert Douglass and Sylvanus Wood, who
joined Parker on the Common at break of day, and
accepted his invitation to become members for that
occasion.</p>

<h2>CONCORD.</h2>

<p>In the vicinity of Concord were two regiments, one
of militia under Col. James Barrett of Concord, with
Ezekiel How of Sudbury as Lieutenant Colonel, and
one of minute-men under Col. Abijah Pierce of Lincoln,
with Thomas Nixon of Framingham as Lieutenant
Colonel, and John Buttrick of Concord as Major.
These two regiments did not appear as such at the
North Bridge, the entire force there at the opening
being under the command of Barrett, who directed the
advance to be led by Major Buttrick. Quite a number
of the Companies of each were in line, but not in
regimental formation.</p>

<p>There were four Concord Companies present, commanded
respectively by Captains Brown, Miles, Minot,
and Barrett. No claims for service were filed with the
Commonwealth in their behalf, therefore, I can present
no official Rolls. I found in Tolman's "Concord
Minute Men" a roster of Brown's Company, and
for those constituting Miles's Company I am indebted
to the rare original manuscript belonging to the late
Dr. Charles E. Clark of Lynn, and which was sold at
auction by C. F. Libbie &amp; Co., in Boston, Jan. 15,
1901, for $275.00.</p>

and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained. For example:
